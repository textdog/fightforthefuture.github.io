        <span class="date">Posted 16:04 EDT on June 25, 2014</span>


        <p><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7qqfur3pM1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019147756"/></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-3fb3b003-d48c-c983-6bc0-cf7f4ef75ae5"><span>On Tuesday, June 24th, a group of activists set up tents and banners in front of Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, CA, announcing their protest online at </span><strong><a href="http://occupygoogle.org" target="_blank">http://OccupyGoogle.org</a></strong><span> and tweeting from </span><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/occupygoogl" target="_blank">@OccupyGoogl</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Late last night, 10 activists, including a journalist who was livestreaming the event, were arrested for trespassing. We at Fight for the Future congratulate these people who are speaking out at this important time. <strong>It gives us hope for the future of the web to see young Internet freedom activists so passionate about this issue</strong> &ndash; and we hope that Google will sit down and talk with them and listen to what they have to say, rather than resort to involving law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you agree, feel free to call the Google press office and leave a message here: 1-650-930-3555.</strong></p>
<p><span>We suggest you be polite, and ask them to meet with the Occupy Google demonstrators and listen to their demands, and not unnecessarily involve the authorities allowing for more arrests.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7qqb6X6lO1ri3xd7.png?1506019147756"/></span></p>
<p><strong>Here’s the background:</strong></p>
<p><span>We didn’t know about this protest ahead of time, but we smiled when we heard the news. We love the transformative power of the free and open Internet and we’ve dedicated the past several years of our lives to building movement to protect it. We think it’s awesome to see that movement growing, and to see passionate people taking action to defend the Internet they love, and help build the Internet they want to see.</span></p>
<p><span>The protester’s demands were pretty simple, really: they were asking Google to engage in a conversation about what Google should be doing to fight for Net Neutrality.</span><span> The activists felt like Google could be doing a lot more, and started the camp-out to apply pressure.</span></p>
<p><span>The context here is that Google has expressed support for Net Neutrality in letters some lobbying, but haven’t yet thrown down on the issue the way they could.</span></p>
<p><strong>It’s an interesting tactic. Here’s how Occupy Google explains their reasoning:<br/></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Though Google and other major companies such as Netflix, Amazon and Microsoft have come out in support of preserving a free and open web, </span><span>we believe much more can be done. </span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span> </span><span>    </span></p>
<p><span>Though many of us have concerns about the larger implications of Google&rsquo;s effect on the world, as far as surveillance and ties to military technology, </span><strong>we are not here to protest Google. <br/></strong><span><br/></span><strong>Google, with its immense power, has a social responsibility to uphold the values of the internet.</strong><span> We encourage Google to engage in a serious, honest dialogue on the issue of net neutrality and to stand with us in support of an internet that is free from censorship, discrimination, and access fees. </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>They went on to explain that they wanted Google to engage in a dialogue with them about how the company could do more to help win net neutrality at this critical moment that will have lasting ramifications for what the Internet of the future will be. They proposed some actions, including Google blacking out their site and pointing to a petition during an online action July 10th. </span><span>But they also left it open ended, offering that Google could </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Create their own creative way to connect their users to this issue and how to fight back.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Adding:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>We are committed to occupying the Google Headquarters until the company gets involved in honest dialogue on net neutrality, and until real action is taken to maintain a free and open internet.</span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>So when it comes down to it, all these folks were asking for was to chat.</span><span> They wanted someone from Google to come out and talk with them about what the company was doing, what it was going to do, and would it do more to defend something they really held dear: the uncensored web.</span></p>
<p><span>Google is a company that professes to care deeply about transparency, openness, and the future of the open Internet. T<strong>he passionate people who set up tents on their lawn were expressing similar goals. </strong></span><strong>It sounds to us like Google leadership probably would have had a great time if they’d brought some lemonade and sandwiches down to the camp and had a chat with these folks, rather than allowing them to be forcibly arrested en masse and charged with trespassing.</strong></p>
<p><span>What harm would it have done for Google to talk with these activists? There are very real types of harm that could come from having them arrested, both to the activists (who could face fines, probation, immigration, and other issues) and to Google, who has now lost a bit more trust from the Internet freedom movement as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span>The Occupy Google activists have </span><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/occupygoogl/statuses/481790399795585024" target="_blank">called for a demonstration today</a></strong><span> outside the Google I/O conference, at Moscone Center 747 Howard St. 12 noon PST. If there are any journalists in the area, we suggest they get down there, but don’t forget to have your lawyer’s number handy&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span>We at Fight for the Future support all forms of creative protest to draw attention to the urgent need for action around net neutrality, and we hope that Google will engage in meaningful conversation with these protesters, and refrain from unnecessarily involving the police or authorities. “Don’t be evil,” Google. Talk it out with these folks and jump in the fight.</span></p>
<p><strong>Finally, though Occupy Google protesters haven’t mentioned this, we’d love to see Google come out strongly in support of the only real path toward lasting net neutrality: reclassifying the Internet as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act.</strong><span> Google has expressed its opposition to Tom Wheeler’s proposal, but hasn&rsquo;t yet echoed the demands of nearly every free speech, Internet policy, or human rights advocacy group in the country that is calling for reclassification. That would be one very clear and meaningful way that Google could show these demonstrators that they are truly committed to net neutrality and keeping the Internet free.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7qqedFqXB1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019147756"/></span></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-06-23-seriously-facebook/">Seriously, Facebook?!</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 17:52 EDT on June 23, 2014</span>


        <p id="docs-internal-guid-8b4b7eb3-cab7-05f7-c1a1-49a3feedbc9d"><span>Hey,</span></p>

<p><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/facebookopt-out/" target="_blank"><span>Facebook just announced a creepy new tracking system that watches you even when you’re not on Facebook. Click here to opt out and say NO!</span></a></p>

<p><span>We’ve done a lot tog</span><span>ether to win real victories against government surveillance, now it’s time to address the big elephant in the room: companies like Facebook, whose business models are fundamentally at odds with their user’s rights.</span></p>

<p><span>Last week, Facebook announced that it will begin tapping into your web browsing and Internet data outside of Facebook to serve ads.</span><span>[1] </span><span>This is incredibly creepy</span><span>. By selling and sharing your and every Internet user’s personal data to private companies and government agencies, Facebook is putting everyone at risk of having their basic rights abused. </span><span>Even if you don’t have a Facebook account, Facebook is still tracking you and handing your information over. [2]</span></p>

<p><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/facebookopt-out/" target="_blank"><span>Click here to see how Facebook is using your web browsing history.</span></a></p>

<p><span>We’re telling Facebook to stop and our campaign is growing fast! </span><span>In the last two days, more than 23,000 of you have already taken action to tell Zuckerberg and Facebook to stop creeping on our every movement on the Internet. And the number of voices joining our action only keep growing each second.</span></p>

<p><span>This could be bad for all of us and not just because Mark Zuckerberg can look at your browsing history. Facebook’s close ties with government agencies like the NSA threaten your and every Internet user’s right to privacy. [3] If Zuckerberg is data mining every trace of your Internet usage, then the NSA has that same data too.[4] That’s why it’s so important that we take action and stop this abuse now.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/facebookopt-out/" target="_blank"><span>Yes, I’ll support the campaign to tell Facebook to stop abusing my right to privacy!</span></a></p>

<p><span>We’ve won major victories for Internet freedom in the past, let’s add this to that list. If we can get enough people to demand that Facebook stop abusing Internet user’s right to privacy, we can stop them. </span></p>

<p><span>For the Internet,</span></p>
<p><span>Kevin, Holmes, Evan, and Tiffiniy</span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future</span></p>

<p><span>P.S. Taking on Facebook’s abuse of privacy is no small task, but our small team is working hard to make this campaign spread wide and far. Can you chip in to help us take on Facebook?</span><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>Please donate $20 (or more) today!</span></a></p>

<p><span>###</span></p>
<p><strong>Dear Fight for the Future member,</strong></p>
<p>You did it! Late last night — after they were bombarded by calls from FFTF members and many others — the U.S. House of Representatives <strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/20/congress-obama-nsa-reform-obama-senate" target="_blank">overwhelmingly voted to cut funding for some of the NSA’s most nefarious backdoor spying programs.</a></strong></p>
<p>There’s no question about it. The tides are turning. We didn’t just win this vote, we won it by a landslide. 293-123.</p>
<p>Our movement is showing it’s power, and organized Internet users are once again proving to be a more formidable force than the U.S. government (or any of the pundits) expected.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go. No matter what happens in Congress, we will need to continue our Reset the Net effort to secure the web through technology. As we know all too well, governments often bend and break the rules they set for themselves, and so far the reforms on the table in Congress don’t do nearly enough to protect the rights of people outside the U.S.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain: we are gaining ground, and the NSA is losing it. We’re beating them back with technology, pushing politicians to cut their funding, and dragging their secretive programs out into the sunlight for all to see.</p>
<p>This vote in congress didn’t happen by magic. So many of us have spoken out in the last year and made it clear in no uncertain terms that mass surveillance is not okay. Our movement has become too big for Congress to ignore. We forced them to go on record supporting change.</p>
<p>We still have much work to do, but today is a day worth celebrating! More soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Kevin, and Evan<br/>Fight for the Future</p>

        <p><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7doypPJOX1ri3xd7.png?1506019147756"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-5893f9a4-b03e-c86b-4ae0-5ab5c716201f"><span><strong>Dear Fight for the Future member,</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Last year, we were 12 votes shy of defunding the NSA&rsquo;s phone spying program&rsquo;s with a last minute amendment. Now we have a chance for another sneak attack, but we could have less than 24 hours to implement it and push it over the edge. Today or tomorrow, U.S. Congress will vote on an Amendment to the &ldquo;must-pass&rdquo; Defense funding bill that &ndash; if it gets enough yes votes &ndash; could close up the backdoors the NSA has been using to spy on all of us (1).</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">This is a significant silver bullet to disrupt the NSA’s blanket spying. But time is running out. Click here to take action right now!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>This Amendment is different. It’s not a big clunky bill that we can expect to get watered down by the corrupt leadership of both parties, it’s more of a Congressional guerilla tactic. Rep. Zoe Lofgren is tacking this Amendment on to the Defense Appropriations Bill, a bill that basically has to pass. She’s forcing the question &ndash; the Amendment basically says that the NSA can’t use any of the funds it’s given to conduct warrantless searches under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, and it also prevents them from building back doors into security products (2).</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Congress doesn’t get many calls about amendments like this. Your voice matters! Click here to contact your reps.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember the Amash Amendment that no one thought had a chance, and then it almost passed and would have defunded some of the NSA’s programs? (3). </strong><span>If we can flood Congress with calls and emails right now, we can cut off one of the NSA’s octopus arms, and actually stop them from using our own tax dollars to spy on us. </span><strong>The vote could happen as early as this afternoon.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Click here to to demand that Congress protect our rights and shut the backdoor the NSA has been using to invade our lives.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’re busy building the next phase of Reset the Net, our ongoing campaign to rid the Internet of mass surveillance through the massive spread of encryption technology, but in the meantime, this is a quick, easy, and satisfying way to make another dent in the NSA’s armor.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all that you do,<br/>Evan, Tiffiniy, and Kevin<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. We think it’s important that we all take action today and help this Amendment pass if at all possible. But we also recognize it’s limitations. Everyone in the world deserves privacy, not just U.S. citizens. That’s why we’re continuing to build a global movement around Reset the Net.
