        <span class="date">Posted 14:06 EDT on July 6, 2016</span>


        <p><b>For Immediate Release</b>: July 6, 2016<br/><b>Contact</b>: Christina DiPasquale, 202.716.1953, <a href="mailto:Christina@balestramedia.com" target="_blank">Christina@balestramedia.com</a></p><p>Today, an unnamed official at the Army revealed unverified information relating to Chelsea Manning’s confidential medical status to the media and Nancy Hollander, lead attorney on her defense team, released the following statement:<br/></p><p>“We’re shocked and outraged that an official at Leavenworth contacted the press with private confidential medical information about Chelsea Manning yet no one at the Army has given a shred of information to her legal team.</p><p>“I had a privileged call scheduled with Chelsea at 2pm Leavenworth time yesterday, after the Army has now said she was hospitalized, but the Army gave the excuse—which I now believe to be an outright lie—that the call could not be connected although my team was waiting by the phone.</p><p>“Despite the fact that they have reached out to the media, and that any other prison will connect an emergency call, the Army has told her lawyers that the earliest time that they will accommodate a call between her lawyers and Chelsea is Friday morning. We call on the Army to immediately connect Chelsea Manning to her lawyers and friends who care deeply about her well-being and are profoundly distressed by the complete lack of official communication about Chelsea’s current situation.”</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a digital rights group that has been supporting Chelsea Manning while in prison. This press release was posted with the approval of her attorneys. </i></p>

Diverse lineups vary per city &amp; include Tom Morello, Evangeline Lilly, Jolie Holland, Las Cafeteras, Anti-Flag, &amp; Flobots</i></h2><p>Internationally acclaimed hip-hop artist <b>Talib Kweli</b> will perform with a full live band at a free concert at <b>Showbox SoDo</b> in Seattle on August 19th to raise awareness about the dangers of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, an anti-democratic “trade” deal that was negotiated in secret with hundreds of corporate advisors. The event is part of the <b><a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank">Rock Against the TPP</a> </b>tour, a series of concerts, protests, and teach-ins organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future and Firebrand Records, the new activist record label from Tom Morello and Ryan Harvey. Today, the tour’s organizers also unveiled additional dates on July 30 in San Diego, CA, and August 20 in Portland, OR. The San Diego date features Jolie Holland and rising East LA Chicano band <b>Las Cafeteras</b>. Golden Globe nominated actress <b>Evangeline Lilly</b> <i>(Lost, The Hobbit, Ant-Man) </i>will act as an emcee at all of the events announced so far.</p><p><b>Click here to see the newly announced tour dates: <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank">https://www.RockAgainstTheTPP.org</a></b> </p><p>The Rock Against the TPP tour kicks off in Denver on July 23 at an event featuring legendary guitarist <b>Tom Morello</b> <i>(Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave)</i>, popular punk band <b>Anti-Flag</b> (who are also performing at the Seattle and Portland stops.), Denver-based hip-hop outfit <b>Flobots</b>, and buzzworthy bi-lingual rockers <b>Downtown Boys</b>. Activists, musicians, and celebrities are coming together to sound the alarm about the toxic deal, which has little to do with trade, but would provide multinational corporations with new rights and powers that threaten good paying jobs, Internet freedom, the environment, access to medicine, and food safety.</p><p>The West Coast tour stops will also feature renowned rock cellist <b>Bonfire Madigan</b> <i>(Kill Rockstars, K Records)</i>, Firebrand Records artist <b>bell’s roar</b>, Puerto Rican vocalist <b>Taina Asili</b>, and Fight for the Future campaign director <b>Evan Greer,</b> the tour’s lead organizer.</p><p>“Working people everywhere have had enough,” <b>said Tom Morello,</b> “The TPP is nothing short of a corporate takeover of our democracy. That’s why people are rising up to stop it. Corporate lobbyists want to sneak the TPP through Congress quietly; that means it’s time for us to get loud.”</p><p>“This fight against the TPP is not about right and left, it’s about right and wrong,” <b>said Evangeline Lilly, </b>“Whatever you’re passionate about, whether it’s human rights, internet freedom, climate change, or food safety, the TPP is a bad deal for humanity, and a threat to the future of democracy. The more people learn about the TPP, the less they like it. It’s our responsibility to sound the alarm, before it’s too late.”</p><p>The <a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank"><b>Rock Against the TPP</b></a> Tour is being organized by<b> <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a></b>, the viral Internet freedom group best known for organizing the largest online protests in history against online censorship and in favor of free speech and privacy. <b><a href="http://firebrandrecords.com/" target="_blank">Firebrand Records</a>,</b> the new social justice infused record label co-founded by Tom Morello and Ryan Harvey, is acting as the tour’s artistic partner. The roadshow is sponsored and co-organized by a diverse coalition of groups fighting against the corporate power grab that is the TPP, including Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America, CREDO, Demand Progress, the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, the Sierra Club, and the Teamsters.</p><p>“The TPP is not a trade deal, it’s a corporate coup––an attack on the future of democracy and free speech,” <b>said Evan Greer, </b>“people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly oppose it, and we’re going to fight not only to stop the TPP, but to make sure that decisions that affect all of us are never made behind closed doors in the future.”</p><p>Additional Rock Against the TPP tour dates and participants will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>###<br/></p><p><b>About Talib Kweli: </b>Brooklyn-based MC Talib Kweli earned his stripes as one of the most lyrically-gifted, socially aware and politically insightful rappers to emerge in the last 20 years.

The group came together as a politically charged response to 2016’s tumultuous election year and after three sold-out club shows announced the launch of a 35-city trek across North America this summer.</p><p><b>About Evangeline Lilly:</b> Evangeline Lilly is an actress best known for her role as Kate Austen in LOST and films including The Hurt Locker, Real Steel, The Hobbit and Ant-Man.

Rolling Stone called them &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Most Exciting Punk Band&rdquo; and NME has declared them a Band to Watch in 2016. They write songs about smashing the prison-industrial complex, racism, queerphobia, capitalism, fascism, boredom, and all things people tell us that try to close our minds, eyes, and hearts. The band is known for their live performances, which are equal parts punk show, political rally, and religious revival. Frontwoman Victoria Ruiz delivers moving speeches between songs, working the crowd into an angry but hopeful frenzy. The songs themselves are delivered with an earnestness, fun, and intensity that&rsquo;s stunned audiences on their tours throughout North America. </p><p><b>About Fight for the Future: </b>Fight for the Future is a non-profit with more than 1 million members dedicated to defending and expanding the Internet’s transformative power for good.

They also made headlines for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDKzwB8GhN0" target="_blank">flying a 30 foot blimp</a> opposing the TPP over Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings in Oregon. Fight for the Future conceived of the Rock Against the TPP effort, and are leading the organizing of the tour, with support from a wide range of public interest groups, labor unions, and grassroots volunteers.</p><p><b>About Firebrand Records: </b>Firebrand is a bold new project from Ryan Harvey (Riot-Folk) and Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine, Audioslave, Prophets of Rage) dedicated to the global release and distribution of radical, socially conscious music. In recent years, people around the world have surprised each other with their courage, strength, and willingness to stand against injustice, militarism, and corruption. And where there has been protest, there has been music. Born from these times, Firebrand gives a platform for such voices. We know that music alone does not change the world, but we recognize that it is an integral part of the movements that do.<br/></p>

        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="90" data-orig-width="728"><img data-orig-height="90" data-orig-width="728" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_o9gf4bzv4o1up8o7g_540.gif"/></figure><h2>More than 7,000 websites protest with a slow loading icon made from Europe’s flag, to demand that European Union regulator BEREC get serious about net neutrality. “EU Slowdown” protest runs until July 18th consultation deadline.</h2><p><br/></p><p>On Tuesday June 28th, more than 7,000 websites are joining the “EU Slowdown” to protest loopholes in Europe’s new net neutrality guidelines. These loopholes would let European ISPs sell Internet “fast lanes” to large companies while putting startups and smaller sites in a “slow lane”. </p><p>To protest EU rules that would let ISPs slow down websites for profit, these sites are running a spinning “slow loading” version of Europe’s logo, linking to a form where people can submit comments to BEREC, Europe’s regulator. (In the US and India, millions of public comments were instrumental in winning net-neutrality victories.) The “EU Slowdown” protest will continue until the comment deadline, 2pm CEST on July 18th.</p><p>The “EU Slowdown” is being organized by <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a> alongside other members of the <a href="https://savetheinternet.eu/" target="_blank">SaveTheInternet.eu</a> coalition. Fight for the Future played a critical role in organizing the grassroots activism that helped win net neutrality in the US, including <a href="http://www.occupythefcc.com/" target="_blank">Occupy the FCC</a>, <a href="http://callthefcc.org" target="_blank">Call the FCC</a>, and the <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a>, a massive online protest in which over 40,000 sites drove over 760,000 comments to the US Federal Communications Commission in one day.</p><p>Many of the thousands of sites that are participating are members of the <a href="https://www.internetdefenseleague.org/" target="_blank">Internet Defense League</a>, a coalition of sites formed after the global protests to stop SOPA that stand at the ready to defend the open Internet against critical threats. Now, this global coalition has less than 20 days to drive a massive number of public comments to EU regulators.</p><p>“In the US and India, unprecedented coalitions of activists and small startups came together to win net neutrality,” said Fight for the Future co-founder Holmes Wilson, “Now it’s Europe’s turn to win. Everything is on the line right now, and we have just weeks to make sure regulators don’t sell out Internet users to please the big ISPs.”</p><p>“If European regulators don’t close these loopholes, telecom giants will be able to roll out paid fastlanes across Europe,” said Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng, referring to <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2016/leak-eus-forthcoming-net-neutrality-rules-heres-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/" target="_blank">loopholes in traffic management and specialized services</a> that allow such practices in the current draft guidelines, “European users will suffer the most—as sites they love are forced to pay for special treatment—but the impact on the open Internet will be felt globally, as telecom giants conspire with tech giants to silence competing voices.”</p><p>The EU Slowdown is being organized by<a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"> Fight for the Future</a> alongside other members of the<a href="https://savetheinternet.eu/" target="_blank"> SaveTheInternet.eu</a> coalition. Fight for the Future is best known for its role organizing the massive SOPA protests and the<a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"> Internet Slowdown</a>, that shifted the tide of the US net neutrality debate. </p>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:08 EDT on June 24, 2016</span>


        <p>For Immediate Release: June 24, 2016<br/>Contact: Alexandra Roose, Spitfire Strategies,<br/>(202) 448-0202, alexandra@spitfirestrategies.com</p><h2><i>Groundswell of Americans Call for the FCC to Take Strong Enforcement Action against Companies Violating Net Neutrality by Controlling Content</i></h2><p>WASHINGTON – Today, more than 100,000 complaints from Americans who support a free and open internet were delivered to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) calling on Chairman Wheeler and the other commissioners to investigate and take strong enforcement action if and when  companies violate the FCC’s Open Internet Order with zero-rating schemes that control individual users’ content choices.</p><p><b>Scroll to the bottom of this post to see photos. These photos are available for use by the media. Credit: courtesy Fight for the Future.</b></p><p>The complaints were delivered together in a “Special Delivery” Package that was left for FCC Commissioners ahead of their June open meeting. This push by more than 100,000 individuals comes on the heels of last week’s court decision upholding the FCC’s Open Internet Order and giving the commission strong legal ground to investigate zero-rating schemes where companies charge tolls or act as gatekeepers on content.</p><p>Helping lead the charge to gather this groundswell of complaints were membership organizations and public interest groups including Fight for the Future, Center for Media Justice, Demand Progress, 18millionrising.org, Daily Kos, Credo Action, and Free Press.</p><p>Many of the complaints were targeted at specific zero-rating schemes by Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile from individual customers. 80,000 of the complaints hand delivered to the FCC today were also delivered into the Open Internet docket in the FCC’s ECFS system. In addition, over 20,000 were delivered into the FCC’s new Zendesk complaints system.</p><p>Today’s delivery of 100,000 individual complaints calling for enforcement actions against zero-rating follows a March 2016<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/zero-rating-plans-are-a-serious-threat-to-the-open-internet/" target="_blank"> letter</a> by 54 advocacy groups urging the FCC to take action against these zero-rating schemes, and a May 2016<a href="http://www.stayopenfcc.org/" target="_blank"> letter</a> to the FCC by more than 50 companies and grassroots organizations calling for an open, public process for zero-rating proceedings.</p><p>“Last year, millions of Americans called on the FCC to protect the open Internet and pass strong Net Neutrality rules. Now that these rules are the law of the land, the FCC should listen to the large number of people who are fed up with their carriers distorting competition and threatening consumer choice with these zero-rating schemes and take action to stop these clear violations of net neutrality,” <b>said Holmes Wilson, Co-Founder and Co-Director of Fight for the Future.</b></p><p>“Our community will not be sold a zero-rated Internet that gives us half the story and half the power to fight back. Every one of us deserves the right to control what content they access and how they share knowledge and express themselves. The 100,000 individuals whose complaints were delivered to the FCC today and millions more around the country won’t stand for these bite sized zero-rated Internet plans that limit how we connect and how we organize,”<b> said Malkia Cyril, founder and Executive Director of the Center for Media Justice (CMJ).</b></p><p>“The same cable and phone companies that fought so hard to destroy Net Neutrality are creating harmful new schemes that pose a serious threat to the open Internet.  The FCC should investigate and take swift action against these zero-rating plans. Furthermore, this decision should not be made behind closed doors&ndash;the FCC should have an open, public process to decide where and how to enforce these rules,” <b>said David Segal, Co-Founder and Executive Director of Demand Progress.</b></p><p>“For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other communities of color, an open internet helps level the playing field by providing spaces for cultural, economic, and political engagement in which our experiences, identities, and language needs are reflected. These zero-rating schemes distort people’s ability to use the applications they want and view the content of their choice, directly attacking everyone’s ability to communicate,”<b> said Cayden Mak, Chief Technology Officer of 18MillionRising.org.</b></p><p>“Internet users won decisively in court last week. That means ISPs can’t block or discriminate against what that their users want. But the FCC also has a duty to make sure broadband is offered on reasonable terms, without artificial penalties for people who have the audacity to actually use the connections they buy. If exemption-riddled data caps disincentive use of the open internet and keep people tied to incumbents’ preferred products, then the FCC has to consider the impact on choice and affordability,” <b>said Matt Wood, Policy Director of Free Press.</b></p><p> ###</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="1280"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/09204c3dc38370eaf94a29e7d47d3d55/tumblr_inline_o9aledQN3v1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="1280"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="854" data-orig-width="1280"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2dd2e2b7cd94e2996842197570f31a4e/tumblr_inline_o9alezvc6V1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="854" data-orig-width="1280"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="1280"><img src="https://67.media.tumblr.com/ba0054a02c7cce186c7579bd4780d3f9/tumblr_inline_o9alebUA741ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="1280"/></figure>
