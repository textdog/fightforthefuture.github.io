The decision is the latest example of the U.S. government’s campaign of harassment and mistreatment of Chelsea, who has been incarcerated in all male military facilities for 6 years.<br/></p><p><b>See a detailed summary of the charges Chelsea faced <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/150739860858/fight-for-the-future-releases-formal-charge-sheet" target="_blank">here.</a></b></p><p><b>Chelsea Manning released the following statement to supporters:</b></p><blockquote><p>“My three member disciplinary board took place today.</p><p>I presented evidence and was allowed to question witnesses through the board president. The hearing lasted four hours. There was a break for lunch.</p><p>I waited nervously for the board to vote. I received the decision after 30 minutes.</p><p>I was acquitted of the &ldquo;Resisting The Force Cell Move Team&rdquo; charge.</p><p>I was found guilty of the &ldquo;Conduct Which Threatens&rdquo; charge. This charge was for the suicide attempt.</p><p>I was found guilty of the &ldquo;Prohibited Property&rdquo; charge, which was for an unmarked copy of &ldquo;Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy,&rdquo; by Gabriella Coleman.</p><p>My punishment is 14 days in solitary confinement. 7 of those days are &ldquo;suspended.&rdquo; If I get in trouble in the next six months, those seven days will come back.</p><p>The term for this status is &ldquo;disciplinary segregation.&rdquo;</p><p>There is no set date set for this to start.

Despite the good news related to medical treatment, Chelsea will now be punished with solitary confinement, which the United Nations has <a href="http://solitarywatch.com/2015/07/24/un-human-rights-experts-again-push-for-access-to-u-s-prisons-call-for-solitary-confinement-reform/" target="_blank"><b>condemned</b></a> as a form of torture. </p><p>The July incident where Chelsea attempted to take her own life followed years of the government systematically denying her access to medically recommended treatment for gender dysphoria, and <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/126526891688/breaking-whistleblower-chelsea-manning-faces" target="_blank">previous threats</a> </b>of solitary confinement following minor prison “infractions,” including possession of mislabeled general research materials that Chelsea used for article writing and an expired tube of toothpaste.	</p><p>After she receives written notification of her solitary confinement sentence, Chelsea has 15 days to appeal the disciplinary board’s decision.</p><p><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><b>Fight for the Future</b></a>, the digital rights group that has been supporting Chelsea, is encouraging all supporters of human rights to sign the petition at <b><a href="http://freechelsea.com" target="_blank">FreeChelsea.com</a> </b>calling for the U.S. government to drop these unjust charges. Celebrities including <b>Michael Stipe</b> of REM, Pentagon Papers whistleblower <b>Daniel Ellsberg</b>, and <b>Thurston Moore</b> of Sonic Youth, have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC23i3ArkcoLSIJ8C02CjX7A" target="_blank"><b>uploaded videos</b></a> speaking out on Chelsea’s behalf and asking fans to sign the petition.

        <span class="date">Posted 16:11 EDT on September 21, 2016</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="512" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://67.media.tumblr.com/d28dd008264e4d389a332ff9d6e47b0a/tumblr_inline_odvezoBNo71ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="512" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>Chelsea Manning faces an administrative disciplinary board tomorrow that may punish her for charges directly related to her July suicide attempt. This board is happening even though it was the government’s own mistreatment of Chelsea that drove her to attempt to take her own life earlier this year.<br/></p><p>The process of preparing for the board has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/chelsea-manning-gender-surgery-suicide-attempt-punishment" target="_blank">very emotional and traumatizing for Chelsea</a>. It requires her to continually relive the painful experience over and over again. Chelsea must prepare her defense completely on her own, and will appear in front of the three person panel alone. She is not permitted to consult with or have an attorney or other advocate present during the hearing. The hearing itself could last for hours and there will be no transcript or account of the proceedings available to the public beyond what Chelsea herself is able to convey.</p><p>Chelsea Manning ended her hunger strike last week after the U.S. military agreed to move forward with some recommended treatment for her gender dysphoria. However, she found out the next day, when she was given a second, more detailed charge sheet, that the Army is continuing to threaten Chelsea with solitary confinement for charges directly related to her attempt to take her own life.</p><p>The news that she will be meeting with a surgeon, and may hopefully receive some of the currently withheld medical treatment for her gender dysphoria, was a huge relief, but that relief has been largely overshadowed by the prospect of solitary confinement. Solitary confinement, because of it’s harmful effects on those subject to it, has been <a href="http://solitarywatch.com/2015/07/24/un-human-rights-experts-again-push-for-access-to-u-s-prisons-call-for-solitary-confinement-reform/" target="_blank">defined by the UN as a form of torture</a>.</p><p>Fight for the Future is making some of the documents from Chelsea’s case available to help better explain what is happening to her.</p><p>These documents provide greater context around the charges. These kinds of minor infractions, in the larger context of what Chelsea is going through right now, is a perfect example of the &ldquo;high tech bullying&rdquo; that she first brought to light when she went on her hunger strike on September 9, 2016. Chelsea describes high tech bullying as “the constant, deliberate and overzealous administrative scrutiny by prison and military officials.”</p><p>The bottom line is that Chelsea could be in solitary by the end of the day tomorrow. &ldquo;They could start punishing her right away,” explains Chase Strangio, her attorney at the ACLU. “Last time, she was able to call afterwards, and the punishment did not start immediately, but we were concerned then that it might have, and we are concerned now.&rdquo;</p><p>Documents provided today for reference:</p><ol><li><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/150729898078/chelsea-mannings-formal-charge-sheet-related-to" target="_blank">Formal Charge Sheet</a> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzTpgEwjZfLIalgweEFYSHlnWWM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">PDF</a>) (Dictated over the phone because the page was missing upon arrival to Chelsea’s counsel).<br/><br/></li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzTpgEwjZfLIRFNybVktTVpsT0k/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Accompanying documents to the Formal Charge Shee</a>t<br/>a) Inmate Disciplinary Reports (pages 2-5)<br/>b) Discipline and Adjustment Board Notification (page 1)<br/><br/></li><li><a href="http://arba.army.pentagon.mil/documents/army%20corrections%20command/Institutional%20Offense%20Policy.pdf" target="_blank">Policy Letter 16</a> (Here’s an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzTpgEwjZfLId2diMWQyRTRFSTg/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">OCR’d PDF</a> of it) - which is referenced repeatedly in the <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/150729898078/chelsea-mannings-formal-charge-sheet-related-to" target="_blank">Formal Charge Sheet</a></li></ol><p>Chelsea sent an envelope of documents, including the <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/150729898078/chelsea-mannings-formal-charge-sheet-related-to" target="_blank">Formal Charge Sheet</a> (the most important document, as far as Chelsea was concerned) to her attorney, Chase Strangio. One document was inadvertently left out, and so Chelsea dictated it to her support network over the phone last night.</p><p>The Formal Charge Sheet, contains three charges: </p><p><b>1. Resisting the Force Cell Move Team </b></p><p>This charge stems from the “force cell team” being activated. They were called to respond to her suicide attempt, though there were no obstructions to the door and Chelsea was unconscious and unable to resist when they arrived. The charge sheet itself specifies on page 5 that &ldquo;Inmate Manning did not resist the force cell move team.&rdquo;</p><p><b>2. Conduct Which Threatens</b></p><p>This charge amounts to disturbing the orderly running of the facility. Chelsea did not ever engage in “threatening behavior,” the prison interprets “conduct that threatens” broadly to encompass any activity that disrupts the normal routine and charging Chelsea because her suicide attempted allegedly did that.</p><p><b>3. Prohibited Property</b></p><p>On July 6th, Gabriella Coleman&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy&rdquo; was found in Chelsea’s cell, allegedly not properly marked with Chelsea&rsquo;s name and inmate number on the inside cover. (A new regulation, that appears to have been crafted in response to Chelsea’s confiscated books/expired toothpaste incident from last summer.) In fact, this book was one of the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/books-they-wont-let-chelsea-manning-read/" target="_blank">books confiscated from Chelsea’s cell last summer</a>.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of people spoke out in support of Chelsea, and now, as a result, the government is finally agreeing to move forward with some of her longstanding medical treatment needs. It is difficult trust even this assurance, though, given that they are on the one hand recognizes that she has an urgent need for treatment but on the other punishing her for the consequences of having had that treatment denied.</p><p>For inquiries, contact: Evan Greer, Fight for the Future, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> </p><p>###</p><p>Excerpts from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzTpgEwjZfLId2diMWQyRTRFSTg/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Policy Letter 16</a>:</p><p><b>1) RESISTING THE FORCE CELL MOVE TEAM CAT IV OR V</b></p><p>For the &ldquo;force cell team to be called to the cell&rdquo; [Section &ldquo;oo&rdquo;]</p><p>Complete text of description from the prison rules:</p><p>Section oo.

However, the Army is continuing to threaten Chelsea with solitary confinement for charges directly related to her attempt to take her own life, even though it was the government’s own mistreatment of Chelsea that drove her to it.  </p><p>Supporters have launched a new effort at <a href="http://freechelsea.com" target="_blank">FreeChelsea.com</a> calling for the charges to be dropped. The site features a petition to the Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning as well as videos uploaded by supporters including Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. </p><p>Chelsea alerted attorneys and supporters that she was ending the hunger strike after government officials showed her a memo stating that she will receive gender-reassignment surgery, under the DOD’s <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/features/2016/0616_policy/DoD-Instruction-1300.28.pdf" target="_blank">new policy</a> affecting transgender service members. If this occurs, Manning will be the first transgender prisoner in the U.S. to receive this medically recommended treatment, setting a precedent that could benefit thousands of transgender prisoner.</p><p>“I am unendingly relieved that the military is finally doing the right thing. I applaud them for that. This is all that I wanted – for them to let me be me,” said Chelsea Manning in a statement to her attorneys. “But it is hard not to wonder why it has taken so long.  Also, why were such drastic measures needed? The surgery was recommended back in April 2016. The recommendations for my hair length were back in 2014. In any case, I hope this sets a precedent for the thousands of trans people behind me hoping they will be given the treatment they need.”</p><p>“It is a relief to hear that the government has finally agreed to move forward with providing Chelsea with the health care that she is legally entitled to and is medically needed. We hope that they will act to provide this care without delay in order to ensure that her suffering does not continue,” said Chase Strangio, Chelsea’s attorney at the ACLU, “This medical care is absolutely vital for Chelsea. It was the government’s refusal to provide her with the necessary care that led her to attempt suicide earlier this year, and it was all the more troubling when she became subject to an investigation and possible punishment in connection with the suicide attempt. We hope that the government recognizes that charging Chelsea with the crime of being denied essential health care is outrageous and drops those charges.”</p><p>“Hundreds of thousands of people spoke out in support of Chelsea, and now the government is finally agreeing to provide her with the healthcare treatment that she needs,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, the digital rights group behind FreeChelsea.com that has supported Chelsea over the last year, “but now that the Army is acknowledging Chelsea deserves this treatment, it’s even more outrageous that they’re still threatening her with solitary confinement for charges related to her own suicide attempt. It was the government’s refusal to grant Chelsea access to needed health care that led to her suicide attempt in the first place.”</p><p>Chelsea’s supporters plan to release more videos to raise awareness about the new petition at FreeChelsea.com in the coming days.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FeYrhdUcfClE"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYrhdUcfClE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>###</p>

The tour, which is the largest mobilization against the TPP in U.S. history, comes to Spontaneous Celebrations in Jamaica Plain from 6pm - 10pm for a FREE concert featuring indie star <b>Mirah</b>, beloved Ethiopian dance-pop troupe <b>Debo Band</b>, renowned Boston hip hop duo <b>Foundation Movement</b>, and more.</p><p>See more details and a full lineup here: <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/boston-ma" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/boston-ma</a> </p><p>The concert will be followed by a teach-in on “How to Fight the TPP” on Saturday, October 8th hosted by experts from a wide range of organizations opposing the TPP. Time and location TBA. </p><p>“The Trans-Pacific Partnership is not about ‘free trade,’ it’s about corruption,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future and lead organizer of the tour, who is based in Jamaica Plain, and organizes the popular Break the Chains LGBTQ dance party series in Boston,</b> “we’re harnessing the power of music and culture to sound the alarm about this corporate power grab and stop it in its tracks.”</p><p>Organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future in partnership with legendary guitarist <b>Tom Morello</b> (Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and riot-folk singer <b>Ryan Harvey</b>’s record label Firebrand Records, previous stops on the tour have featured high-profile participants including actress <b>Evangeline Lilly,</b> hip hop icon <b>Talib Kweli,</b> comedian <b>Hari Kondabolu</b>, Dead Kennedys singer <b>Jello Biafra</b>, legendary punk band <b>Anti-Flag</b>, Danbert Nobacon of the UK sensation <b>Chumbawamba</b>, Adult Swim comedian <b>Eric Andre</b>, and ANTI records songwriter <b>Jolie Holland</b>. The roadshow has already drawn <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WMeQZ" target="_blank"><b>large crowds</b></a> in Denver, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco.</p><p>The TPP has little to do with trade, but instead grants multinational corporations extraordinary new powers to threaten jobs, the environment, affordable medicine, free speech, and food safety. The Rock Against the TPP tour brings together a broad coalition of supporters including digital rights groups, labor unions, environmental groups, and small businesses, and is sponsored by Backbone Campaign, Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America (CWA), CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth, the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, SumOfUs, the Teamsters, and United Steelworkers. Organizers plan to announce additional dates to the tour soon.</p><p>Additional performers at the October 7th event include afro-latin rock group Taina Asili y La Banda Rebelde and Firebrand Records artist Bell’s Roar.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/photos-video-massive-crowd-giant-blimp-protests-trans-pacific-partnership-at-rock-against-the-1733f9ed1fa1#.xkq7oohiw" target="_blank"><b>SEE PHOTOS AND VIDEO AVAILABLE FOR USE BY PRESS HERE.</b></a></p><p>For Interviews with Artists or Organizers, please contact Evan Greer at <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> or (978) 852-6457.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org</a> </p><p># # #</p>
