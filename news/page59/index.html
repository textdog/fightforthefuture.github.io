        <span class="date">Posted 11:59 EDT on September 22, 2014</span>


        <p><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ncb8g4rKqq1r1kl7d.jpg?1506019146471"/></p>
<p>Fight for the Future is proud to join civil liberties advocates, organizations from across the political spectrum, and whistleblowers like Daniel Ellsberg in urging members of Congress to <strong>oppose</strong> the NSA reform bill known as the USA FREEDOM Act (S. 2685). Last week, our coalition sent the following letter to members in the House and Senate.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1286294/letter-to-congress-opposing-usa-freedom-act.pdf" target="_blank">The letter (PDF)</a> was signed by whistleblowers William Binney, Thomas Drake, Daniel Ellsberg, Mark Klein, Edward Loomis and J. Kirk Wiebe, as well as Campaign for Liberty, CREDO Action, Emptywheel, Fight for the Future, Firedoglake, OffNow, Participatory Politics Foundation, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Progressive Change Institute, Restore The Fourth, RootsAction.org, Sascha Meinrath, Tenth Amendment Center, The Rhode Island Coalition to Defend Human and Civil Rights, The Sunlight Foundation and ThoughtWorks.</p>
<p>If you support true reform for the intelligence community, please <strong><a href="http://action.firedoglake.com/page/s/usa-freedom-act" target="_blank">add your name to this letter</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://action.firedoglake.com/page/s/usa-freedom-act-call" target="_blank">call your elected officials</a></strong> to urge them to vote “no” on the USA FREEDOM Act.</p>
<p><strong>Media contact</strong>: press@fightforthefuture.org</p>
<p>—LETTER TRANSCRIPT—</p>
<p>Dear Members of Congress,</p>
<p>We, the undersigned civil liberties advocates, organizations, and whistleblowers, are alarmed that Senator Leahy’s recently introduced bill, the USA FREEDOM Act (S. 2685), legalizes currently illegal surveillance activities, grants immunity to corporations that collaborate to violate privacy rights, reauthorizes the PATRIOT Act for an additional 2.5 years, and fails to reform EO 12333 or Section 702, other authorities used to collect large amounts of information on Americans. For these reasons, we encourage both the House and the Senate to oppose this legislation in its current form.</p>
<p>Governmental security agencies’ zeal for collecting Americans’ personal information without regard for cost, efficacy, legality, or public support necessitates that Congress act to protect the rights of residents across the United States and around the globe. Our fundamental civil rights – the human rights we hold dear – are not adequately protected by either the Senate or House versions of the USA FREEDOM Act.</p>
<p>The reckless actions of top officials charged with ensuring national security – from lying to Congress to secretly weakening security standards to hacking the communications of our allies – has undermined global confidence that the United States can act as an ethical Internet steward. The 11th-hour gutting of the USA FREEDOM Act in the House of Representatives and the CIA’s recent illegal spying on the U.S. Senate underscore just how powerful and out of control this surveillance regime has become. Time and again, these agencies have relied on aggressive manipulation of legal loopholes to thoroughly undermine safeguards and checks and balances.</p>
<p>As just one example of why clarity in law is now necessary, the collection of information on all domestic phone calls was justified under the “relevancy” standard in the PATRIOT Act. The NSA claimed that all domestic telephone metadata records were “relevant” to ongoing terrorism investigations and therefore legally collectible. This absurd interpretation – that everyone’s calls were relevant and no probable cause was needed – was then rubber-stamped by a secret court in an ex parte hearing. Such secret law is repugnant to the Fourth Amendment and the plain meaning of the legal authorities on which the Intelligence Community has relied.</p>
<p>The USA FREEDOM Act (S. 2685) also contains ambiguities that are ripe for abuse:</p>
<p>The bill does not define “direct connection” in the new Call Detail Record provision of Section 215. This may permit the government to access the data from Americans’ smart phones through telecommunication providers, which the USA FREEDOM Act immunizes from customer lawsuits. This would be an expansion of the NSA’s current authority.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/07/30/might-get-fooled-again-the-senate-and-surveillance/" target="_blank">Loopholes in Section 215</a>, such as the authority to collect phone records in other than daily production or to use a corporation, organization, or government entity as a specific selection term, still permit bulk data collection, and the bill’s transparency provisions do not include production under those loopholes in reporting requirements.</li>
<li>The bill expands on the emergency provision approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) in February, creating new powers for the government to retain data and introduce it as evidence even if the courts reject the NSA’s petition to collect it.</li>
</ul><p>S. 2685 fails to substantially rein in surveillance, and stops short of establishing adequate oversight:</p>
<ul><li>The bill does not safeguard against warrantless (“back door”) searches on the content of Americans’ communications collected under Section 702.</li>
<li>The bill does not require reporting on the FBI’s warrantless searches of U.S. persons’ content, even when there is no evidence of wrongdoing against those people. Similarly, it does not require reporting on the collection of things like credit card records or information about Western Union transfers, among many other kinds of information, which would allow the government to hide ongoing bulk collection of those items.</li>
<li>The bill <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/meet-executive-order-12333-the-reagan-rule-that-lets-the-nsa-spy-on-americans/2014/07/18/93d2ac22-0b93-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html" target="_blank">does not</a> prevent the use of Executive Order 12333 to conduct bulk collection.</li>
</ul><p>S. 2685 fails to protect against future privacy invasions of innocent people. At a minimum, meaningful privacy safeguards should:</p>
<ul><li>Protect individuals from surveillance where they are not within two degrees of direct communication with an individual subject to authorized surveillance, and prohibit holding of information collected about innocent people. These protections should be expressed as affirmative rights of United States persons, not merely as a modification to a single law.</li>
<li>Prohibit <a href="http://webpolicy.org/2013/12/09/metaphone-the-nsa-three-hop/" target="_blank">the use of metadata</a> for connection chaining where it represents contact with companies or federal, state, or local governments. Because so many people rely on these entities, such as Google or municipal governments, contact chaining through them would collect substantial amounts of information on most Americans.</li>
<li>Prohibit the government from hacking into or otherwise interfering with companies and other non-governmental organizations, and the people whose information they hold, so long as they comply with warrants and court orders.</li>
<li>Preserve the rights of Americans to pursue legal recourse against companies where they fail to exercise reasonable care in protecting individuals’ information, including at the request of government actors not acting pursuant to a legal warrant or court order. The bill currently gives blanket immunity to companies responding to any government order, no matter how outrageous.</li>
<li>Include efforts made by the U.S. House of Representatives, such as the Lofgren-Massie Amendment and the Grayson amendments focused on rehabilitating the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act.</li>
<li>Improve oversight by creating reporting processes and protections for whistleblowers that disclose information to members of Congress.</li>
<li>Require more than summaries of the secret interpretations of law made by government agencies and the FISC.</li>
<li>Not reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act.</li>
</ul><p>Congress must narrowly and unambiguously define the Intelligence Community’s surveillance authority. Sen. Leahy’s USA FREEDOM Act fails this basic test, and is not the substantive reform originally envisioned and supported by the public.</p>
<p>Indeed, the USA FREEDOM Act has significant potential to degrade, rather than improve, the surveillance status quo. At best, even if faithfully implemented, the current bill will erect limited barriers to Section 215, only one of the various legal justifications for surveillance, create additional loopholes, and provide a statutory framework for some of the most problematic surveillance policies, all while reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act. Given the several broad legal authorities claimed as justifications for mass surveillance of United States persons and non-United States persons, it remains unclear if the Senate’s USA FREEDOM Act would end any of the Intelligence Community’s clandestine programs to surveil Americans.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we call on the House and the Senate to reject this version of the USA FREEDOM Act. As long as S. 2685 contains ambiguous language that can be abused by the Intelligence Community and lacks language that clearly protects innocent Americans, we believe that focusing on USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization next year, remedies in the courts, aggressive confirmation hearings for personnel, and defunding of Intelligence Agencies are more constructive paths forward.</p>

<p><strong>Net neutrality activists set up giant video billboard outside the FCC</strong></p>
<p><em>Domain registrar Namecheap and #InternetSlowdown organizers Fight for the Future have parked a truck with an 11&rsquo; video billboard directly across from the FCC building in Washington, DC. Title II supporters will play a steady stream of net neutrality videos sent from Internet users around the world. The billboard will remain through the FCC’s comment deadline tonight and during their Roundtable hearings on Tuesday.</em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON&ndash; Building off the momentum of last week’s </span><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><span><strong>record-breaking Internet Slowdown protest</strong></span></a><span>, net neutrality supporters have obtained a permit to park a truck with a roof-mounted 11’ wide video billboard directly outside FCC headquarters in Washington, DC. The billboard will be playing a stream of net neutrality related videos sent in from the Internet, including videos from today’s </span><strong><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/97229228063/whats-next-after-the-slowdown-rally-with" target="_blank">net neutrality rallies</a></strong><span> in NYC, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and webcam appeals from Internet users everywhere explaining why net neutrality matters to them.</span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future has posted an appeal for Internet users to submit videos to play on the billboard here: <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/97569336053/fight-for-the-future-and-namecheap-have-parked-a-truck" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/97569336053/fight-for-the-future-and-namecheap-have-parked-a-truck</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Scroll to the bottom of this release for some initial photos. More photos will be available soon, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4v6p1nrfej6ybzp/AADRJ8mzOXNOZUlwyrJ1h7HKa?dl=0" target="_blank">some high-res photos available here.</a><br/></strong></p>
<p><span>The billboard action is supported by Fight for the Future, but is being coordinated by domain registrar Namecheap, who participated in the Internet Slowdown, and have released their own viral video to educate the Internet public about what’s at stake in the fight for net neutrality. Internet Slowdown organizers Free Press are also supporting the action, and are </span><strong><a href="http://act.freepress.net/survey/sept_16_fcc_action/" target="_blank">coordinating a gathering</a></strong><span> outside the FCC on Sept 16th at 11:45am.</span></p>
<p><span>“Washington DC is worlds away from the vast majority of Internet users who would suffer from the FCC’s current proposal,” </span><strong>said Ted Worcester, Head of Product at Namecheap, who is camped out with a laptop running the video billboard across the street from the agency’s headquarters, </strong><span>“The video billboard helps give more people a way to get their message right in front of the FCC. Thanks to the open Internet, its easy for people to send us videos about why net neutrality matters to them.” </span></p>
<p><span>“The FCC is in a pretty lonely part of Washington DC,” </span><strong>said Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Fight for the Future,</strong><span> “Hopefully this video billboard will help brighten things up– with the voices of millions of people who are passionate about keeping the Internet free.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Advocacy groups have been calling for months for the FCC to get out of Washington DC to hear from the public before they make a decision that would allow for discrimination on the Internet,” </span><strong>said Evan Greer, Campaign Director of Fight for the Future, who helped coordinate the billboard effort,</strong><span> “If the FCC won’t go to the people, we’ll bring the people to the FCC, projected larger than life on a billboard that can’t be ignored. They need to get the message that we&rsquo;re not going away &ndash; it’s Title II or bust.”</span></p>
<p><strong>The action on the 16th is supported by <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>, <a href="http://www.freepress.net/" target="_blank">Free Press</a>, <a href="https://demandprogress.org/" target="_blank">Demand Progress</a>, and <a href="http://www.popularresistance.org/" target="_blank">Popular Resistance</a></strong><span><strong>.</strong> Fight for the Future, Free Press, and Demand Progress all contributed to organizing the </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">Battle for the Net</a></strong><span> </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a></strong><span>, in which over 40,000 websites (including huge sites like Reddit, Namecheap, Netflix, Etsy, Vimeo, Mozilla and many more) ran prominent warnings of an impending slowdown of Internet speeds if the FCC ends net neutrality. During the protest, Internet users made over </span><span>760,000</span><span> comments to the FCC and over </span><span>300,000</span><span> phone calls to Congress <strong>(See: </strong></span><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Infographic: the Internet Slowdown in Numbers and Screenshots</a>).</strong></p>

<p>This just in! We&rsquo;ve teamed up with our friends at domain registrar Namecheap to bring the overwhelming public outcry for real net neutrality protections directly to the agency&rsquo;s doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>As the hours count down to the FCC&rsquo;s net neutrality comment deadline, we have obtained a permit to park a truck with a giant video billboard on top directly across the street from the FCC facing the agency&rsquo;s headquarters! It&rsquo;s amazing! We&rsquo;re attracting tons of attention already.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VobzCnTgrQt75LQwmkNGhFNlwvHDONpWxwWtNKB5wa0/viewform" target="_blank"><strong>Got something to say to the FCC? Send us a link to your video and we&rsquo;ll play it on the billboard!</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Are you in Washington, DC? </strong>Join us, Free Press, and Popular Resistance on Tuesday, September 16th as we gather near the billboard to call for the FCC to get out of DC and listen to the public! <a href="http://act.freepress.net/survey/sept_16_fcc_action/" target="_blank"><strong>More info here.  </strong></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be here until the end of the day Tuesday playing a steady stream of videos about net neutrality. The FCC needs to hear from everyone &ndash; but not everyone can make it to DC to speak out. <strong>The billboard gives us all a platform from which to speak, just like the free and open Internet!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internet, send us your videos! Take a short 1-2 minute video of yourself explaining why net neutrality matters to you, and we&rsquo;ll play it on the billboard for Tom Wheeler and everyone at the FCC. Use the form below to submit your video or email it directly to ted@namecheap.com with the subject line &ldquo;Billboard submission.&rdquo;</strong></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-09-13-this-infographic-will-make-your-day-unless-you/">This infographic will make your day, unless you happen to be a Comcast lobbyist</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 15:06 EDT on September 13, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nbut27U0mN1r1kl7d.png?1506019146471"/></span></a></p>

<p><span>Hey!<br/><br/></span><span>Thanks to you, the Internet Slowdown was a resounding success. More people took action to defend net neutrality in one day than ever before in history. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Click here to check out this inspiring infographic showing what we did together on September 10th. It will seriously make your day, unless you happen to be a Comcast lobbyist. </a></strong></p>
<p><span>Have a look. Like what you see? </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Please chip in $5 so we can keep the fight going.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The slowdown was so big it was impossible to ignore. Several members of Congress tweeted about how their phones were ringing off the hook, and we dominated the mainstream news headlines. More than 40,000 websites took part, including many of the most popular sites in the world, and at the peak of the day, there were more than 1,000 phone calls to congress </span><span>every minute!<br/><br/></span><span>This changes everything. Victory is more tangible now than ever before. But we still need to bring it home. <strong>Now that we’ve shown our strength, the giant Cable companies that are lobbying tooth and nail to destroy net neutrality will redouble their efforts</strong>, and work every connection they have to keep the public’s voice from being heard in Washington, DC.</span><span><br/><br/>There’s only one solution: we have to fight even harder, and grow our movement even larger, and we have to be ready to battle for the net for the long haul.</span></p>
<p><span>Organizing the Internet Slowdown day and hosting the website used up a huge amount of our resources. </span><strong>Will you chip in $5 (or more!) today to make sure we can keep the pressure on while we have so much momentum?</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Yes, I will chip in today to save net neutrality!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>All of us here at Fight for the Future are so proud of the Internet right now. Now more than ever it&rsquo;s so clear how powerful the Internet really is as a platform for free speech, and how absolutely critical it is that we not only fight for it, but we fight to win.</span></p>
<p><span>With gratitude and determination,<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Evan, Jeff, Kevin, Vasjen, and Jessica<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. The deadline to submit comments to the FCC is this Monday, September 15th. We’re helping plan protests on that day in NYC and Philadelphia. There’s still time to submit a comment. If you haven’t yet, what are you waiting for?! Here’s the link: </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com</a></strong></p>
<p><span>P.P.S We really want everyone to see this infographic, it’s so epic! Check it out here: </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/infographic</a></strong></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-09-12-update-internet-slowdown-numbers-even-bigger-than/">UPDATE: Internet Slowdown numbers even bigger than we thought!</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:48 EDT on September 12, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nbt3s21j8q1qb05d0.png?1506019146471"/></span></a></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6b97-e923-fafa-5c921440286b"><span>We have the latest numbers from the Internet Slowdown day of action, and a few awesome screenshots to verify them.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;re proud to announce that the Internet Slowdown generated an incredible response! The flood of comments coming through <strong><a href="http://Battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Battleforthenet.com</a></strong> was on the same order of magnitude as the total comments the FCC has received over the </span><span>entire </span><span>comment period. Suffice it to say the response quickly overwhelmed the FCC’s comment submission system early on Wednesday; the load was so large that they still don&rsquo;t have all the submissions in the docket yet. That’s why the FCC </span><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/khart/status/510112656460873728" target="_blank">does not have an official</a></strong><span> tally at the moment. </span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span> A few news outlets have incorrectly reported much lower numbers, which were provided to reporters in error by the FCC. The number the FCC gave was just the number their failing website was able to process at the time. Since Tuesday, we had been working with the FCC to help make sure their servers stayed up. Early Wednesday, the FCC asked us directly to stop our submissions until the site came back online, or until they could find new ways to accept them (</span><strong><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/additional-option-filing-open-internet-comments" target="_blank">which they announced, late yesterday</a></strong><span>).</span></p>
<p><strong>The FCC communications team knew this at the time, but one of their spokespeople (we hope in error) provided the misleading 100,000 number to reporters. We asked the FCC several times to correct this error publicly in the form of a tweet. <strike>They have not done so yet.</strike></strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: The FCC has just published partial numbers totaling over 3 million, implying a jump of well over 1 million during the #InternetSlowdown. Thanks to the publication of this new total, journalists should be able to infer from this number that the 100,000 number was an error. <br/></strong></p>
<p>They <em>have</em> said that a final count is coming <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_2031221044"><span class="aQJ">on Tuesday</span></span>, that any number up until now hasn&rsquo;t been official, and that they may publish a preliminary count this weekend. We&rsquo;d welcome that. The sooner the 100,000 number gets corrected the better.</p>
<p><strong>The final number, when it arrives, will be huge.</strong></p>
<p><span>For now, the latest Internet Slowdown numbers are:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Number of websites participating using our tools</strong>: </span><span>40,806</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Calls made to Congress: our number + tumblr # + 30,000 from other companies</strong>:<span class="cwcot" id="cwos"><span class="cwcot"><span id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6bb0-6595-1271-3f7fa91a1281"> 312,171</span></span></span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Emails sent to Congress via battleforthenet.com</strong>:</span><span> 2,332,092</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Comments filed at the FCC via battleforthenet.com</strong>: </span><span>777,364</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Peak calls per minute to Congress from battleforthenet.com</strong></span><span>: </span><span>1,000</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Facebook shares of spinning icon</strong>: </span><span>more than 1,120,000</span></p>

<p><span>These numbers represent only the statistics that we can easily count and verify. Many websites directed people to call their representatives using other tools, or linked directly to emails for lawmakers and the FCC, so we know many more people took action on September 10th.</span></p>

<p><span>These numbers are higher than previous numbers we released on Wednesday, as more submissions have come in, and we’ve received more stats from participating websites. Also, our system for automatically counting the number of sites that had installed the widget was overwhelmed early during the protest, and when we looked into it we realized the number was much higher than we had originally reported (over 40,000 – not 10,000).</span></p>

<p><span>Check out our infographic for more of the story: </span><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic" target="_blank"><span><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic</a></span></a></p>

<p><span>Read below for technical details regarding the numbers.</span></p>

<p><strong>40,806 sites participated using our tools:</strong></p>

<p><br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Phone calls:</strong></p>

<p><span>The Internet Slowdown generated<span><strong><span class="cwcot"><span> 312,171</span></span></strong></span> phone calls to lawmakers. During peak hours, the rate of phone calls surpassed 1,000 calls per minute.</span></p>

<p><span>Here’s a screenshot from the back-end of the Twilio account used for calls from Battleforthenet.com, showing 143,074 calls completed:</span></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nbt32guKFB1qb05d0.png?1506019146471"/></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6bd1-09d8-0eec-f2eb8a9915d0">Here’s a screenshot from the Mobile Commons account Tumblr used for the calls they drove from their </span><a href="https://tumblr.com/stop" target="_blank"><span><a href="https://tumblr.com/stop" target="_blank">https://tumblr.com/stop</a></span></a><span> page showing 136,307 calls completed.</span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nbt5nftj5y1qb05d0.png?1506019146471"/></p>

<p><span>Additionally, Kickstarter, Etsy, and other sites helped drive more than <span id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6baf-8feb-a1d2-72487e2b862b">32,790</span> calls from their own tools.</span></p>

<p><span>Adding these numbers together: 143,074 + 136,307 + <span id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6bb0-1c35-6b69-b0218dfb21bc">32,790</span> = <strong><span> 312,171</span> calls</strong></span></p>

<p><span>Finally, here is a screenshot from 9/10/2014 Noon EST showing 1,000 phone calls per minute:</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Form submissions resulting in FCC comments and emails to Congress:</strong></p>

<p><span>777,364 people used Battleforthenet.com to submit a comment to the FCC on September 10th, and to trigger emails to their representatives. Each person sent 3 emails (one to each Senator and one to their rep in the House,) resulting in the total number of emails sent: 2,332,092</span></p>

<p><span>Here is a screenshot from the back-end of our Compose.io account showing the 777,364 submissions:</span></p>

<p><span>Other big numbers that have come in but were not included in our roundup include, OpenMedia.ca&rsquo;s reported 150,000 actions taken, and the many more comments that websites and national grassroots organizations submitted directly to the FCC.</span></p>
