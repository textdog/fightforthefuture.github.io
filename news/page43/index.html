        <span class="date">Posted 17:44 EDT on May 13, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 13, 2015</p><p>Media Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>WASHINGTON––This afternoon the U.S. House of Representatives passed the USA Freedom Act, a bill that reauthorizes section 215 of the PATRIOT Act until 2019 and allows the government to continue their mass surveillance of phone call data.<br/></p><p>Fight for the Future has opposed the USA Freedom Act and, working with <a href="http://sunsetthepatriotact.com" target="_blank">a coalition </a>of other privacy groups, helped to drive tens of thousands of calls and hundreds of thousands of emails to Congress calling for real NSA reform and an end to Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. The group also created a website <b>(<a href="http://www.usafreedom.fail" target="_blank">www.usafreedom.fail</a>)</b> that explains in eight bullet points why the bill increases mass surveillance, which<b> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/35q5yx/congress_set_to_override_court_ruling_that_nsa/" target="_blank">flew to the top of reddit</a></b> shortly after it was launched. </p><p>The passage of the bill comes less than a week after the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 2nd District ruled unanimously that the government’s bulk collection of call data under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act is illegal. The House’s action today are a step towards overriding the court decision and legitimizing the NSA’s expansive and illogical interpretation of the law. </p><p><b>Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future, issued the following statement:</b></p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Congress has an opportunity to reform mass surveillance by letting the PATRIOT Act expire, and that&rsquo;s what they should do. Their vote today to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act with even broader terms that expand the scope of surveillance, is the opposite of reform. It makes absolutely no sense.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>There is literally no reason for the NSA to be surveilling everyone and their mom in order to go after their targets. Why they aren&rsquo;t satisfied with the US Constitutional limits on search and seizure and getting a warrant to do so is very suspicious. That&rsquo;s just rogue and illegal behavior and part of selling a culture of fear. We&rsquo;re demanding to see them build a case to surveil my mom and millions of Internet users around the world before they get one more peek at our private lives.&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>Congress is trying to sell the USA Freedom Act to the American people as reform, but what the bill actually does is extend and expand the government’s power to monitor our communications under the PATRIOT Act. Far from reform, the bill will allow the government to invade even more of our private moments than ever by updating their surveillance powers for the devices and communications platforms we use most often these days.”</i></p><p><i>This is a fake privacy bill. Corrupt members of Congress and their funders in the defense industry are attempting to package up their surveillance-powers wishlist and misleadingly brand it as ‘USA Freedom.’ This is disappointing and offensive, and we will continue to work to kill this bill and any other attempt to legitimize unconstitutional surveillance systems.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future favors allowing Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act expire on June 1, 2015, as is currently scheduled under the law. The provision allows the government to secretly force anyone to turn over “any tangible things” that they deem to be relevant to an authorized investigation, as determined by the secretive, rubber-stamp FISA court. It is fundamentally flawed authority and a direct violation to the U.S. Constitution’s restriction on unreasonable search and seizure. </p><p>Fight for the Future <b><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/nov/19/how-usa-freedom-act-failed-on-all-fronts" target="_blank">also opposed</a> </b>last year’s version of the USA Freedom Act, calling for more meaningful reforms. </p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:09 EDT on May 13, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 13, 2015<br/><br/>Media contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>WASHINGTON, DC –– Yesterday, the Senate voted against advancing Trade Promotion Authority legislation, more commonly known as “Fast Track.” Fight for the Future, a digital rights group that has been rallying websites and Internet users to oppose Fast Track and has driven tens of thousands of contacts to Congress in recent weeks, released the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p><i>“The writing is on the wall, the only question left is whether our lawmakers can read it. It&rsquo;s obvious that people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly oppose secretive trade negotiations, “Fast Track” legislation, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</i></p><p><i>A few months ago, Fast Track looked inevitable. But as people across the country learned that government bureaucrats and corporate lobbyists were trying to legislate through backroom deals with virtually no public oversight, they stood up in massive numbers. When it became clear that Fast Track and the TPP would be detrimental to Internet freedom, thousands of websites and tech companies joined the fight as well. </i></p><p><i>People, advocacy groups, and startups are uniting against Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership because policies that could lead to decreased online privacy, stifled innovation, and global Internet censorship affect everyone. This isn’t a battle between “liberals” and the Obama administration. It’s a battle between the overwhelming majority of people and small businesses that stand to lose if this deal goes through, and a few select industries that have been spending millions lobbying to protect their own power at the expense of everyone’s basic rights.”</i></p></blockquote><p><b><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>,</b> a group that was founded in the lead up to the fight against SOPA, has been one of the most active online groups opposing Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. They were lead organizers of the <b><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank">Internet Vote</a>,</b> which has generated more than 6,500 phone calls and 75,000 emails to Congress, and gathered the support of more than 7,500 websites and tech companies. They also built the <b><a href="http://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">StopFastTrack.com</a> </b>coalition site, which has garnered the support of more than 100 organizations working on a wide range of issues.</p><p>Last month, Fight for the Future made national headlines when they followed Senator Ron Wyden around his home state of Oregon <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">with a 30’ blimp</a> as part of ongoing protests against Fast Tracking the TPP. They also <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/114761456603/media-advisory-internet-activists-to-park" target="_blank">parked a <b>JUMBOTRON</b></a> on Capitol Hill as part of an anti-Fast Track film fest. Last year, the group <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/letter" target="_blank"><b>delivered a letter</b></a> to Senator Ron Wyden signed by more than 25 companies including reddit and imgur opposing Fast Track legislation. </p><p>###</p>

        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 12, 2015</p><p>Media contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>WASHINGTON, DC –– Today the Senate will vote on whether or not to advance Trade Promotion Authority legislation, more commonly known as “Fast Track.” Fight for the Future, a digital rights group that has been rallying websites and Internet users to oppose Fast Track, released the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p><i>Today, every United States Senator has a decision to make: will they stand with the overwhelming majority of their constituents who oppose the dangerous secrecy inherent in the Fast Track / Trade Promotion Authority process, or will they bow down to the White House and the incumbent industries who have been spending millions lobbying to protect their power?<br/></i></p><p><i>Many media outlets frame this as a fight between “liberals” and the Obama administration, which couldn’t be further from the truth. People from across the political spectrum oppose both Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, due to extreme copyright and Internet policy provisions that could lead to decreased online privacy, stifled innovation, and global Internet censorship. </i></p><p><i>Millions of Internet users and thousands of websites, startups, and tech companies have spoken out. Today, we find out who the Senate is listening to. If they value democracy and the future of the Internet, they will oppose advancing Fast Track / Trade Promotion Authority legislation, and demand that the public have access to agreements negotiated in their name.</i></p></blockquote><p><b><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>,</b> a group that was founded in the lead up to the fight against SOPA, has been one of the most active online groups opposing Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

        <span class="date">Posted 14:36 EDT on May 12, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="676" data-orig-width="540"><img data-orig-height="676" data-orig-width="540" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_no922d9Qp11s45cnp_540.png?1506019144742"/></figure><p>
On May 7th, 2015, the Second District Court of Appeals
ruled that the NSA&rsquo;s bulk collection of phone call data using Section 215 of the Patriot
Act, as revealed by Edward Snowden,
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/nsa-phone-records-collection-ruled-illegal-by-appeals-court.html?_r=0" target="_blank">
is illegal</a><b>.</b> <br/></p><p>This decision, if upheld, would end the NSA&rsquo;s capability
to suck up bulk phone call data.
</p><p>
Now Congress is trying to pass a bill—
the Orwellian “USA Freedom Act”—that would give this power back to the NSA through
new legal loopholes while appearing on the surface to reign-in the NSA. <br/></p><p>The bill is getting voted on <a href="http://www.majorityleader.gov/floor/" target="_blank">this week</a>.
Don&rsquo;t be fooled. It is designed to appease the public while cementing
the government&rsquo;s surveillance authority for years to come. <br/></p><h2>USA Freedom Act doesn&rsquo;t just fail to reform mass surveillance; it extends and expands it.</h2><ul><li>
<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2048/text/ih#link=VII_705_a_%7ET1&amp;nearest=H3970213DCD8B4A7C9D2AC368B1ADFDCA" target="_blank">
Extends Section 215 of the Patriot Act until 2019</a> while modernizing
it so it can suck up more information on the devices we use most commonly.

The bill expands
call data from landlines to include VoIP calls and video chats, and likely will allow
the government to access all data related to smartphone activity.
</li>
<li>
Claims to end bulk collection, but would allow the government to continue collecting huge amounts of data
by using broad <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2048/text/ih#link=I_107_%7EQ1_k_4&amp;nearest=H5592D08FDB5A4ADB9058380404287523" target="_blank">search terms</a> to target big portions of the population and then conducting surveillance on

“emergency” powers</a> for the government to collect all kinds
of personal data without prior court approval. The government could use 
this authority to suck up and retain massive amounts of data.

Allows the FBI to access data collected for counterterrorism investigations
and use it for investigations outside of counterterrorism cases. The FBI

lets the government block the advocate from seeing any and all information</a>
they choose to keep secret from them.
