        <span class="date">Posted 10:50 EDT on June 9, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>The package included a satirical letter from the President and an actual rubber stamp with the words, “I approve President Obama’s secret trade deal”</i></h2><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, evangreer@gmail.com</p><p>WASHINGTON, DC –– Late last week, House Republicans started to receive hand-delivered packages in large white envelopes addressed to each Representative by name and purportedly “from” President Barack Obama. The packages contained a satirical letter to Congress from the President asking Republicans, “Please rubber stamp my secret trade agenda.” The packages also contained a rubber stamp of the President&rsquo;s face along with the text, “I approve President Obama’s secret trade deal.” Finally, the packages contained a fact sheet headlined, “Facts to Ignore when Rubber Stamping my Trade Deal.”<b><br/></b></p><p><b>See PHOTOS and VIDEO of the packages being delivered here: <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/121088291048/photos-video-house-republicans-receive" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/121088291048/photos-video-house-republicans-receive</a></b> </p><p>Today, the digital rights group, <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, revealed that they were behind the action. Fight for the Future issued the following statement, which was also mailed anonymously to several media outlets:</p><p>“People from across the political spectrum oppose Fast Track/Trade Promotion Authority because we have learned that when our government acts in secret, it is never in the public’s best interest.</p><p>Republicans who claim to advocate for individual liberty should know better than to vote for legislation that gives unprecedented powers to the executive branch to make decisions in secret that affect everything from national sovereignty, to U.S. patent laws, to internet freedom.</p><p>Any Republican who decides to go against the majority of their constituents and rubberstamp the Trans-Pacific Partnership will learn come election that paying lip service to liberty while endorsing tyranny is a fast track to losing the faith of the American public.”</p><p>Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer added, “Given all the secrecy surrounding insider deals for Fast Track legislation and classified agreements like the TPP and TISA, we thought it was apropos to have a bit of mystery surrounding our protest too. Congress is supposed to listen to their constituents, not party leadership, not the White House, not industry lobbyists––the people they represent. We sent them these stamps as a reminder, and to show them that the public is watching, and will remember how they vote.”</p><p>Fight for the Future made headlines in March when they <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wydenblimp/" target="_blank">flew a 30’ blimp</a> over several of Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings calling for him to “Save the Internet” by opposing Fast Track for the TPP.</p><p>Fight for the Future is a nonprofit that has driven more than 100,000 emails and phone calls to Congress in recent months, rallied more than 7,500 websites for an <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank">online protest</a>, and helped coordinate <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/20/hundreds-tech-companies-oppose-tpp-trade-agreement" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Congress from more than 250 tech companies expressing transparency and tech related concerns about Fast Track legislation. The group is best known for their role organizing the <a href="http://www.sopastrike.com/numbers" target="_blank">massive online protests</a> against SOPA, the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> for net neutrality, and the <a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Reset The Net</a> campaign for online privacy, which was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/edward-snowden-privacy-reset-the-net" target="_blank">endorsed</a> by Edward Snowden. </p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 18:25 EDT on June 2, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>June 2, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p><i>Major sections of the Patriot Act expired on June 1, 2015, in line with the public sentiment. Yet Congress moves to revive the mass surveillance powers.</i></p><p>On Tuesday, June 2, 2015, 67 US Senators voted to give the government back its legislative justification for executing mass surveillance on the phone calls of all Americans. </p><p>Each member of the Senate who voted for the USA Freedom Act will now be on record for re-instating—with full knowledge of its illegal usage—a piece of the largest scale violation of the US Constitution in America’s history. They will carry that failure into the next elections, and through the rest of their political careers.</p><p>“The public wants a complete end to mass suspicionless surveillance, not more government deception and doublespeak,” s<b>aid Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“Sunsetting the Patriot Act was a step toward the major structural changes we need to restore privacy, and now Congress is taking a giant leap in the wrong direction with the USA Freedom Act, which revives one of the most badly abused pieces of legislation in U.S. history. It’s enough to make even the most trusting citizens question the intentions of their government.”</p><p>&ldquo;We have made it clear to the world these programs are useless and need to end. What we did was change the conversation from should we end mass surveillance to how? The answers Congress is coming up with so far, like the faux reform USA Freedom Act, are wrong and dangerous. But at least the public has forced them to start asking the right questions’&rdquo; <b>added Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future. </b></p><p>&ldquo;The sunset of the Patriot Act provisions marks a historic moment that–for the past 13 years until just weeks ago–was unthinkable. It happened because of massive public pressure to see these programs end, and because a few senators, including Senator Paul, had the courage to actually listen to the public, and to take a stand for their own principles and the principles embodied in the Constitution. By passing USA Freedom Congress just threw that victory away. But for a brief moment, if the administration was in fact following the law, Americans were able to call their loved ones without the government tracking them.That alone is worth celebrating, but now Congress is moving to take that freedom away once again,&rdquo; <b>added Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Fight for the Future. </b></p><p>In the weeks leading up to the expiration deadline for Section 215 of the PATRIOT ACT, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/privacy_poll_results.pdf" target="_blank">polls were released</a> which showed the public&rsquo;s opposition to the government’s surveillance of U.S. citizens. In addition, a report from the Department of Justice identified these programs as ineffective for counter-terrorism. The public also organized against these programs, sending hundreds of thousands of emails and calls to Congress, <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119583384473/protesters-gather-in-dozens-of-cities-to-call-for" target="_blank">organizing 40+ vigils</a> at senators’ district offices, <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/120193407718/thousands-of-websites-call-for-sunset-of-the" target="_blank">blacking out Congress’ access</a> to tens of thousands of websites, and coordinating letter drop-offs at lawmakers’ district offices. </p><p>Fight for the Future and dozens of other groups have vowed to continue the fight to end mass government surveillance, working toward a full repeal of the Patriot Act, FISA Amendments Act, and other structural changes needed to restore our basic human right to communicate privately and express ourselves freely. Fight for the Future will continue its work to spread easy-to-use, strong encryption tools through campaigns like <a href="http://resethenet.org" target="_blank">Reset the Net</a>, to protect people everywhere from rogue government programs, like those reauthorized today. </p><p>“Thanks to Edward Snowden and the free and open Internet, the global public is more aware than ever before of the U.S. government’s abusive spying operations. The members of Congress who just voted to reauthorize and expand these programs will soon learn that the Internet-using public is not easily fooled, and we will not forget the names of the politicians who raised their hands and voted to take away our freedoms mere moments after we had restored them,” c<b>oncluded Greer.</b></p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 21:23 EDT on May 31, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>The fake-reform bill is an attack on civil liberties and codifies some of the worst mass surveillance abuses of the PATRIOT Act</i><br/></h2><p>The expiration of key PATRIOT Act provisions &ndash; even if only temporary &ndash; is a victory for the countless civil liberties activists in every congressional district in the country who, since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on government surveillance, have fought for real reform. It demonstrates that the public can win battles in Congress that just a few years ago we were barely able to fight at all.</p><p>However, the Senate failed the American people today. Despite overwhelming evidence that Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act violates our civil liberties without making us safer, the Senate overwhelmingly bowed to pressure from surveillance agencies and voted to advance a bill that would renew their illegal and ineffective mass surveillance authorities under the PATRIOT Act.</p><p>The USA FREEDOM Act is a mass surveillance bill dressed up as a reform bill, and its passage will authorize unconstitutional surveillance practices.</p><p>Given the cloture vote, it seems very likely that the USA FREEDOM Act will pass. But if that happens, each member of the U.S. Senate will be on record for re-instating, with full knowledge of illegal implementation, the largest scale violation of the U.S. Constitution in America’s history &ndash; one that is overwhelmingly unpopular with voters, and they will carry that failure through the rest of their political careers.</p><p>The expiration of the some of the worst abuses of the PATRIOT Act completely changes the political dynamics in the fight to end mass surveillance. The overwhelming majority of the sitting members of Congress never voted on the PATRIOT Act, and if they vote to reinstate Section 215 they will have gone on the record and must take direct responsibility for authorizing clearly unconstitutional and profoundly unpopular spying.</p><p>We will continue fighting to repeal the PATRIOT Act and the FISA Amendments Act, rein in the surveillance state, and place real checks on government surveillance.</p><p>“As a telecom that can be compelled to participate in unconstitutional spying on Americans accused of no crimes, it’s of the greatest urgency that we end the worst abuses of the PATRIOT Act,” <b>said Becky Bond, Vice President of CREDO Mobile.</b> “Our surveillance agencies have gone rogue, and sunsetting the PATRIOT Act &ndash; even if just for a few days &ndash; is the first real step we’ve taken toward restoring civil liberties taken away in the wake of the September 11th attacks. Elected officials who voted to restore this dangerous mass surveillance authority via the USA FREEDOM Act cannot going forward claim to carry the mantle of civil liberties reform.”</p><p>&ldquo;The overwhelming majority of Americans who don&rsquo;t want to be indiscriminately spied on by their very own government have brought their will to bear in this fight &ndash; and have upended the inside-the-Beltway conventional wisdom that said a sunset was impossible,” s<b>aid David Segal, Executive Director of Demand Progress. </b>“The fiercely contested battle over the PATRIOT Act and its temporary sunset demonstrate the growing power of the mass movement to reform America&rsquo;s out-of-control surveillance agencies. With the expiration of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, each senator must now go on record and publicly decide whether to protect our civil liberties or codify unconstitutional government spying all over again through the USA FREEDOM Act.&rdquo;</p><p>“Sunsetting the Patriot Act is the biggest win for ending mass surveillance programs, and one that conventional DC wisdom said was impossible. We are seeing history in the making and it was because the public stood up for our rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association – and there’s no turning back now,” s<b>aid Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future. </b></p><p>“It was like Congress had some sick fetish for George Orwell jokes, or couldn’t wait for the next Hunger Games to come out,” <b>said Fight for the Future co-founder, Holmes Wilson,</b> “They were about to reauthorize spying on the emails and calls of every American with a bill called ‘USA Freedom!’&quot;</p><p><b>Press call Monday morning:</b></p><p>The organizations behind this release, and others, will take part in a press call to discuss the sunset and the USA FREEDOM Act tomorrow morning.</p><p><b>WHAT:</b> An hour-long press call to discuss the Senate vote on the USA Patriot Act and the USA FREEDOM Act</p><p><b>WHEN:</b> 9:00am EST Monday, June 1, 2015</p><p><b>WHERE: </b>RSVP Ashley Houghton at Ashley@rethinkmedia.org for call in details.<br/></p>

No one wants to live in a world without privacy where they aren’t free to express themselves. People will continue to stand up and fight for free speech, and Congress should expect nothing but resistance until they end these abusive programs that threaten our most basic rights.”</p><p>###</p>
