      <h1><a href="/news/2017-06-26-fccs-response-to-inquiries-about-alleged-ddos/">FCC’s response to inquiries about alleged DDoS attack raises more questions than answers</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 17:13 EDT on June 26, 2017</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, June 26, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>Why wasn’t the agency using basic protection that could have prevented alleged cyber attacks that silenced pro-net neutrality voices?</i></h2><p>The FCC <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9t2hnplz4-aS3plM1RRQ0t2ZlUwWTRyTVhta0ZDVDZRU1lJ" target="_blank"><b>has responded</b></a> to a letter from Senators Wyden and Schatz requesting more information about an alleged DDoS attack that took down the agency’s comment system immediately following John Oliver’s viral segment about net neutrality, during a time when large numbers of concerned citizens were attempting to register their support for Title II.</p><p>The FCC’s response, however, raises more questions than answers. The agency’s explanation of the attack makes it seem as if they have not yet identified or taken steps to address the bottlenecks or flaws in their architecture to prevent their system from collapsing at another critical moment. It’s the responsibility of anyone running an important site like the FCC’s electronic comment filing system to employ basic cybersecurity practices that prevent abuse and outages, including the ability to block malicious traffic by IP address, and simple scaling strategies, like caching slow database queries. The agency also claims the attacks came from “cloud providers.” <b>If this is the case, cloud providers keep records of the exact resources used by each account for billing purposes. Why hasn’t the FCC employed legal means to identify who allegedly attacked their systems? And why haven’t they used the same legal means to attempt to identify the attacker that is submitting hundreds of thousands of fraudulent comments using stolen identities, in violation of federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1001)?</b></p><p>The bottom line is that the FCC failed to take basic steps to prevent these alleged DDoS attacks &ndash; as well as the widely reported flood of fake anti-net neutrality comments, have refused to release information that would assist in an investigation into who is behind them, and have failed to take steps to prevents something like this from happening again.</p><p>“Ajit Pai and the FCC are blatantly trying to sweep this under the rug, so I’m not surprised that they issued their response on a Friday afternoon, hoping that it would go unnoticed,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“But the fact remains that large numbers of people were prevented from voicing their legitimate concerns about the agency’s plan to dismantle net neutrality protections, while at the same time they have refused to do anything about the massive number of fake anti-net neutrality comments that have been submitted using stolen names and addresses. The agency must address these serious issues before moving forward, or it is making it clear that it has lost all legitimacy and is simply working on behalf of the very companies that it is supposed to be protecting consumers from.”</p><p>Members of Congress also responded to Ajit Pai’s letter with additional questions for the agency. See their response<b> <a href="https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ec-and-ogr-dem-leaders-raise-alarms-about-alleged-cyberattack-that-blocked" target="_blank">here. </a></b></p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:43 EDT on June 22, 2017</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="599" data-orig-width="912"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/4c7b9fc8523c2fa95f03ccb12d87bc27/tumblr_inline_orymkworIj1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="599" data-orig-width="912"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, June 22, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>Thousands of websites plan massive online protest for July 12th. Other participants include Amazon, Reddit, Netflix, OK Cupid, Mozilla, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, and PornHub</i></h2><p></p><p>Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Twilio, Plays.tv, and Adblock are among latest major web platforms to join the Internet-Wide <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank"><b>Day of Action</b></a> to Save Net Neutrality scheduled for July 12th to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal framework for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation. Companies participating will display prominent messages on their homepages on July 12 or encourage users to take action in other ways, like through push notifications and emails.</p><p>The momentum comes against the backdrop of a recent Morning Consult / POLITICO poll <b><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/21/poll-shows-broad-bipartisan-support-net-neutrality-rules/" target="_blank">that shows</a> </b>broad bipartisan support for net neutrality rules. “This protest is gaining so much momentum because no one wants their cable company to charge them extra fees or have the power to control what they can see and do on the Internet,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“Congress and the FCC need to listen to the public, not just lobbyists. The goal of this day of action is to make them listen.”</p><p>More than 40,000 people, sites, and organizations have signed up to participate in the effort overall, and more announcements from major companies are expected in the coming days. Many popular online personalities including YouTuber <a href="https://twitter.com/PhillyD/status/872200755020578816" target="_blank">Philip DeFranco</a>, and dozens of major online forums and subreddits have also announced their participation.</p><p><b>See the announcement for the day of action here: <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/july12</a>  </b></p><p>The effort is led by many of the grassroots groups behind the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the Internet Slowdown. The day of action will focus on grassroots mobilization, with public interest groups activating their members and major web platforms providing their visitors with tools to contact Congress and the FCC.</p><p>Companies participating include Amazon, Netflix, OK Cupid, Kickstarter, Etsy, Reddit, Mozilla, Vimeo, Y Combinator, GitHub, Private Internet Access, Pantheon, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Patreon, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile, Goldenfrog, Fark, Chess.com, Imgur, Namecheap, DuckDuckGo, Checkout.com, Sonic, Brave, Ting, ProtonMail, O’Reilly Media, Discourse, and Union Square Ventures. Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, EFF,  Internet Association,  Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, Rock the Vote, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, MoveOn, Internet Creators Guild, and many others. <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank">See the full list here.</a></p><p><b>Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said:</b> “The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and we’re not going to let the FCC take that power away from us. Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn that net neutrality is not a partisan issue and Internet users will not tolerate these attacks on our basic rights &ndash; we will come together to protect the web as an open platform for free expression and exchange of ideas.” </p><p><b>Michal Rosenn, General Counsel at Kickstarter, said: </b>“A threat to net neutrality is a threat to the free exchange of ideas that creative culture and an informed public rely upon. Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.” </p><p><b>Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: </b>&ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”</p><p><b>Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said: </b>“Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”</p><p><b>Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said:</b> “The FCC&rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.” </p><p><b>Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said:</b> &quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&rdquo;<br/></p><p><b>Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said:</b> “It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.”</p><p><b>Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said: </b>&ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said: </b>&ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&rsquo;d put both us and our customers&rsquo; innovation at risk.&quot; </p><p>###</p>

The agency has an obligation to remove falsified statements in its procedure and to publicly disclose whatever information it has about who is behind this,” she added.</p><p>Thousands of people agree, having signed <b><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-the-fcc-remove-fake-comments-immediately-and-call-for-an-investigation-by-the-appropriate-authorities" target="_blank">a petition</a> t</b>hat echoes the demands of victims and calls for the FCC to take the following actions: “[1] Notify all who have been impacted by this attack, [2] remove all of the fraudulent comments, including the ones made in our names, from the public docket immediately, [3] publicly disclose any information the FCC may have about the group or person behind the 450,000+ fake comments, and [4] call for an investigation by the appropriate authorities into possible violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (“Making false statements”) and other relevant laws.”</p><p>Fight for the Future has launched <b><a href="https://www.comcastroturf.com/" target="_blank">Comcastroturf.com</a> f</b>or Internet users to find out if a fake anti-net neutrality comment was submitted to the FCC in their name and address.</p><p>Fight for the Future encourages journalists to investigate this situation, and is calling for the FCC to disclose any information it has pertaining to the person or organization behind this attack. Further, we encourage journalists to ask ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T whether they are funding this activity, or providing funding for groups that could be engaging in this activity.</p><p>###</p><p>[1]<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/</a> </p><p>[2] <a href="https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc</a> <br/>[3]<a href="http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/" target="_blank">http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/</a> [4]<a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead</a></p><p>[5] <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/05/26/victims-demand-fcc-remove-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/#1ffbf336e793" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/05/26/victims-demand-fcc-remove-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/#1ffbf336e793</a> </p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2017-06-06-major-web-companies-and-public-interest-groups/">Major web companies and public interest groups announce Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 07:59 EDT on June 6, 2017</span>


        <figure data-orig-width="1182" data-orig-height="570" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/6e3fd5821fd08c5b247898d96c5fbdb8/tumblr_inline_or4julmlXh1ri3xd7_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1182" data-orig-height="570"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, June 6, 2017</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>Organizations behind largest online protests in history plan massive action on July 12th. Initial confirmed participants include Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Reddit, Mozilla, Vimeo, GitHub, and Y Combinator</i></h2><p>Internet activists and major websites <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank"><b>have announced</b></a> an “Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality” scheduled for July 12th to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal framework for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation.</p><p><b>See the announcement for the day of action here: <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/july12</a> </b> </p><p> The effort is led by many of the grassroots organizations who have organized the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the Internet Slowdown. The day of action will focus on grassroots mobilization, with public interest groups activating their members and major web platforms providing their visitors with tools to contact Congress and the FCC.</p><p> The organizing for the day of action has just begun, but already as of today’s announcement more than 30 public interest groups and 15 major companies have signed on in support of the effort.</p><p>Companies participating include Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Reddit, Mozilla, Vimeo, Y Combinator, GitHub, Private Internet Access, Pantheon, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Patreon, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile. Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, and many others.</p><p><b>Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said:</b> “The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and we’re not going to let the FCC take that power away from us. Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn that net neutrality is not a partisan issue and Internet users will not tolerate these attacks on our basic rights &ndash; we will come together to protect the web as an open platform for free expression and exchange of ideas.”</p><p><b>Michal Rosenn, General Counsel at Kickstarter, said: </b>“A threat to net neutrality is a threat to the free exchange of ideas that creative culture and an informed public rely upon. Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.”</p><p><b>Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: </b>&ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”</p><p><b>Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said: </b>“Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”</p><p><b>Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said:</b> “The FCC&rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.”</p><p><b>Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said:</b> &quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&rdquo;<br/></p><p><b>Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said:</b> “It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.”</p><p><b>Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said: </b>&ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&rdquo;<br/></p><p><b>Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said:</b> &ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&rsquo;d put both us and our customers&rsquo; innovation at risk.&rdquo;</p><p>###</p>
