        <span class="date">Posted 12:28 EDT on May 17, 2017</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="479" data-orig-width="1165"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/128c092cba364193bac9ec434adbac8e/tumblr_inline_oq3uz6Tm8H1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="479" data-orig-width="1165"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 17, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, 978-852-6457</p><h2><i>Numerous individuals have confirmed that personal information was used to file comments without their permission, data analysis shows likely connection to stolen databases. Fight for the Future demands answers.</i></h2><p>Amid numerous media reports about suspicious anti-net neutrality comments that have been submitted into the FCC docket, digital rights group Fight for the Future is calling on Internet users, the FCC, and state Attorneys General to investigate this potential case of mass identity fraud. The group has launched a website: <a href="http://comcastroturf.com" target="_blank"><b>Comcastroturf.com</b></a>, where Internet users can check if their personal information was used to file a comment without their permission and contact the authorities to request an investigation.</p><p>“The FCC is still refusing to release proof of an alleged DDoS attack that silenced voices in support of Title II net neutrality protections, and now there is significant evidence that a person or organization has been using stolen names and addresses to fraudulently file comments opposing net neutrality,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“If this FCC has any legitimacy, it simply cannot move forward until an investigation has been conducted. We need to know who is doing this, if Ajit Pai or other FCC officials knew that it was happening, and whether any of this illegal activity has been funded by companies like Comcast and Verizon who have a long history of financing astroturf groups. State Attorneys General should immediate investigate whether people in their state were affected by this, and the FCC should immediately release any and all information that it has about who is submitting these fake comments.”</p><p><b>Here’s what we know:</b></p><ul><li><b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/" target="_blank">Numerous</a> </b>media outlets have <b><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15610744/anti-net-neutrality-fake-comments-identities" target="_blank">reported</a> </b>that more than 450,000 suspicious comments &ndash; all containing the same misleading rhetoric, many submitted in alphabetical order and in perfect formatting, opposing net neutrality protections &ndash; have been submitted into the FCC’s docket. It seems extremely likely that a significant portion of these comments are completely fake, and were submitted using real people’s names and addresses without their permission.<br/><br/></li><li>Journalists have <b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/" target="_blank">spoken</a> </b>to <b><a href="http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/" target="_blank">many people</a> </b>whose personal information was used to file an anti-net neutrality comment who confirmed that they never filed such a comment. <br/><br/></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15626278/net-neutrality-spam-bot-fcc-leak-data" target="_blank"><b>Various</b></a> security researchers <a href="https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc" target="_blank"><b>have noted</b></a> that a significant portion of the suspicious anti-net neutrality comments use names and addresses found in breached databases including River City Media and Modern Business Solutions. Statistical analysis shows a much greater percentage of the anti-Title II comments use information found in leaked/stolen lists than other comments.<br/><br/></li><li>Fight for the Future directly interviewed more than a dozen people and confirmed that they had not filed the comments in question, nor had they signed any petitions that could conceivably have used that comment text. Our campaigner knocked on doors in her zipcode in Tampa, FL and spoke in person to several people whose information had been used to file a comment without their permission. <b>We interviewed these people thoroughly and ensured that they understood the issue well enough that they could not have filed a comment and forgotten about it. </b><br/><br/></li><li>The FCC <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-11-what-is-the-fcc-hiding-thousands-call-for-the/" target="_blank">has refused</a> </b>to show evidence for its claim that a DDoS attack took down their site during the exact same time that large numbers of pro net neutrality comments would have been flowing in from John Oliver’s segment on Last Week Tonight. Security experts and even a former senior FCC staffer <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-11-what-is-the-fcc-hiding-thousands-call-for-the/" target="_blank">have disputed</a> </b>their unfounded claims, raising questions about whether the agency is actively trying to silence supporters of net neutrality while knowingly accepting fraudulent comments opposing it. <br/><br/></li><li>Fortune <b><a href="http://fortune.com/2017/05/15/net-netrality-comments-fcc-spam/" target="_blank">has reported</a> </b>that if you remove the suspicious comments, 97% of the remaining comments are in support of Title II based net neutrality protections.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2014, it was <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/net-neutrality-is-marxist-according-to-this-koch-backed-astroturf-group" target="_blank">widely reported</a> that a group allied with the cable &amp; telecom lobby, <b><a href="https://www.americancommitment.org/" target="_blank">American Commitment</a>, </b>rented space on several email lists oriented towards older conservative voters and sent misleading emails soliciting comments to the FCC opposing net neutrality rules. Given the large number of comments they collected (~1 million) the cost of the list rentals would have been extremely high.<br/></li></ul><ul><li>It was also<b> <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/net-neutrality-email-american-commitment-116553" target="_blank">reported in Politico</a></b> in 2014 that the American Commitment letter was submitted to members of Congress using suspicious, out-of-district addresses, including from constituents who didn’t recall sending such a message.<br/></li></ul><ul><li>The text of the misleading anti-net neutrality comment has <b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/" target="_blank">been tied to</a> </b>the relatively unknown group Center for Individual Freedom. The group claims that they have been collecting signatures through an online web form, but that form does not appear on their website or social media. It would be extremely unusual, if not impossible, for a letter that is not visible on the web or social media to attract even tens of thousands of signers, much less hundreds of thousands. <b>The only way to accomplish that would be to spend potentially tens of millions of dollars on list rentals and advertising.</b><br/></li></ul><p>Fight for the Future encourages journalists to investigate this situation, and is calling for the FCC to disclose any information it has pertaining to the alleged DDoS incident and the person or organization behind these likely fraudulent comments. Further, we encourage journalists to ask Cable companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T whether they are funding this activity, or providing funding for groups that could be engaging in this activity.</p><p>###</p>

        <figure data-orig-width="700" data-orig-height="422" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/16781460742b9cdf9b32f1e18495d5ba/tumblr_inline_opsdme6jgL1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="700" data-orig-height="422"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, May 11, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, 978-852-6457</p><h2><i>Fight for the Future has launched a petition calling for the FCC to release its logs to an independent analyst and guarantee that all comments will be counted</i></h2><p>Thousands of people have signed <b><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/did-the-fcc-make-up-a-fake-cyber-attack-to-cover-up-the-fact-that-they-lost-comments-from-net-neutrality-supporters" target="_blank">a petition</a> </b>calling for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to come clean about alleged DDoS attacks that the agency claims occurred at the exact same time that comments would have started flooding in from John Oliver’s viral Last Week Tonight <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak" target="_blank">segment</a> </b>about net neutrality on Sunday night. </p><p>The petition echos Fight for the Future’s <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-09-the-evidence-suggests-that-the-fcc-is-likely/" target="_blank">demand</a></b> that the FCC release their logs to an independent security researcher or major media outlet who can verify their claims and inform the public about what really happened here. </p><p>“The public wants to know what the FCC is hiding,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future,</b> “The future of the Internet is too important to be decided without transparency and adequate input from the public. They’ve been lying to us for weeks about net neutrality, it’s very difficult to accept their claims about DDoS attacks when they have provided zero evidence to support them.”</p><p>The FCC also claims that they experienced a similar attack after Oliver’s segment on the issue in 2014. The agency has provided zero proof for either of these claims, in the face of the much more likely explanation: the FCC’s system is unprepared to handle large amounts of comments, and turned away tens of thousands of people trying to comment in support of net neutrality. </p><p>Gigi Sohn, a former senior staffer at the FCC, said “The official FCC position in 2014 was not that there was a DDoS attack following the John Oliver segment, because there was no clear evidence that such an attack occurred.” </p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><ul><li>The FCC’s servers <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/861962863245742084" target="_blank"><b>went down again</b></a> on Monday night around 8:30pm EST, shortly after the John Oliver segment re-aired on HBO.<br/><br/></li><li>They have continued to <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/862340597016821760" target="_blank"><b>show errors</b></a> this week. <br/><br/></li><li>Former FCC employees deny FCC CIO David Bray’s claim that the agency was hit with a DDoS attack after the John Oliver segment in 2014 and say there was never any evidence of such an attack (see above.)<br/><br/></li><li>The FCC’s servers were having a variety of problems and went down repeatedly as a result of net neutrality comments in the weeks leading up to the John Oliver segment on Monday. Emails from FCC employees sent to Fight for the Future confirm that they were having “server issues.”<br/><br/></li><li>In 2014 and 2015 the FCC’s website crashed several times under the weight of net neutrality comments from the public.<br/><br/></li><li>It can be difficult to distinguish a DDoS attack from a large amount of traffic coming from legitimately concerned citizens looking to file a comment. If the FCC was able to determine that this was a malicious attack, they must have some proof of that, and they should immediately disclose that to the public to verify their claims.<br/><br/></li><li>The FCC now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/08/the-fcc-says-an-attack-not-john-oliver-hampered-its-website/?utm_term=.877558c2d609" target="_blank"><b>claims</b></a> that they have upgraded their site to a “cloud service,” which is consistent with our suspicion that their servers simply buckled under the pressure and they are only now upgrading them, likely after silencing large numbers of pro-net neutrality commenters.</li></ul><p>Here is our original statement, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer, (pronouns: she/hers)</p><p>“The FCC’s statement today raises a lot of questions, and the agency should act immediately to ensure that voices of the public are not being silenced as it considers a move that would affect every single person that uses the Internet.</p><p>There are two possible scenarios and they are both concerning:</p><ol><li>FCC is being intentionally misleading, and trying to claim that the surge in traffic from large numbers of people attempting to comment following John Oliver’s segment amounts to a “DDoS” attack, in order to let themselves off the hook for essentially silencing large numbers of people by not having a properly functioning site to receive comments from the public about an important issue, or <br/><br/></li><li>Someone actually did DDoS the FCC’s site at the exact same time as John Oliver’s segment, in order to actively prevent people from commenting in support of keeping the Title II net neutrality rules that millions of people fought for in 2015.</li></ol><p>Given Ajit Pai’s <b><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/trump-overturn-net-neutrality-rules-resistance" target="_blank">open hostility</a> </b>toward net neutrality, and the telecom industry’s <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality" target="_blank"><b>long history</b></a> of astroturfing and paying <b><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/shady-conservative-group-is-flooding-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments" target="_blank">shady organizations</a> </b>to do their dirty work, either of these scenarios should be concerning for anyone who cares about government transparency, free speech, and the future of the Internet.<br/></p><p>The FCC should immediately release its logs to an independent security analyst or major news outlet to verify exactly what happened last night.

      <h1><a href="/news/2017-05-09-the-evidence-suggests-that-the-fcc-is-likely/">The evidence suggests that the FCC is likely wrong, or lying about claim of DDoS attacks at exact moment of John Oliver net neutrality segment</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:51 EDT on May 9, 2017</span>


        <figure data-orig-width="400" data-orig-height="160" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/351f01c414938d23b8450e81d9942d0e/tumblr_inline_opp2nh1rp41ri3xd7_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="400" data-orig-height="160"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, May 9, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, 978-852-6457</p><h2>Fight for the Future calls for the agency to release its logs to an independent analyst, guarantee that all comments will be counted</h2><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) continues to tell the press that it experienced a DDoS attack at the exact same time that comments would have started flooding in from John Oliver’s viral Last Week Tonight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak" target="_blank">segment</a> about net neutrality on Sunday night. They are now also claiming that they experienced a similar attack after Oliver’s segment on the issue in 2014. The agency has provided zero proof for either of these claims, in the face of the much more likely explanation: the FCC’s system is unprepared to handle large amounts of comments, and turned away tens of thousands of people trying to comment in support of net neutrality. </p><p><b>Here’s what we know:</b></p><p>-The FCC’s servers <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/861962863245742084" target="_blank">went down again</a> </b>on Monday night around 8:30pm EST, shortly after the John Oliver segment <a href="http://www.hbo.com/schedule?date=2017-05-08" target="_blank"><b>re-aired</b></a> on HBO. <b>(See screenshots of our logs showing these errors at the bottom of this post.)</b></p><p>-The FCC’s servers were having a variety of problems and went down repeatedly as a result of net neutrality comments in the weeks leading up to the John Oliver segment on Monday. Emails from FCC employees sent to Fight for the Future confirm that they were having “server issues.”<br/></p><p>-In 2014 and 2015 the FCC’s website crashed several times under the weight of net neutrality comments from the public.</p><p>-It can be difficult to distinguish a DDoS attack from a large amount of traffic coming from legitimately concerned citizens looking to file a comment. If the FCC was able to determine that this was a malicious attack, they must have some proof of that, and they should immediately disclose that to the public to verify their claims.</p><p>-The FCC now <b><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/08/the-fcc-says-an-attack-not-john-oliver-hampered-its-website/?utm_term=.877558c2d609" target="_blank">claims</a> </b>that they have upgraded their site to a “cloud service,” which is consistent with our suspicion that their servers simply buckled under the pressure and they are only now upgrading them, likely after silencing large numbers of pro-net neutrality commenters. </p><p><b>Here is our original statement, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer, (pronouns: she/hers)</b></p><p><i>“The FCC’s statement today raises a lot of questions, and the agency should act immediately to ensure that voices of the public are not being silenced as it considers a move that would affect every single person that uses the Internet.</i></p><p><i>There are two possible scenarios and they are both concerning:</i></p><ol><li><i>FCC is being intentionally misleading, and trying to claim that the surge in traffic from large numbers of people attempting to access following John Oliver’s segment amounts to a “DDoS” attack, in order to let themselves off the hook for essentially silencing large numbers of people by not having a properly functioning site to receive comments from the public about an important issue, or <br/><br/></i></li><li><i>Someone actually did DDoS the FCC’s site at the exact same time as John Oliver’s segment, in order to actively prevent people from commenting in support of keeping the Title II net neutrality rules that millions of people fought for in 2015.</i></li></ol><p><i>Given Ajit Pai’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/trump-overturn-net-neutrality-rules-resistance" target="_blank">open hostility</a> toward net neutrality, and the telecom industry’s <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality" target="_blank">long history</a> of astroturfing and paying <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/shady-conservative-group-is-flooding-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments" target="_blank">shady organizations</a> to do their dirty work, either of these scenarios should be concerning for anyone who cares about government transparency, free speech, and the future of the Internet.<br/></i></p><p><i>The FCC should immediately release its logs to an independent security analyst or major news outlet to verify exactly what happened last night.
