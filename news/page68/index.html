        <p><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7a3izU2MF1ri3xd7.png?1506019147929"/></a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Dear Fight for the Future member,<br/><br/>We know how to fight the NSA. Finally.<br/><br/>It’s been one year since the Snowden leaks and, with Reset the Net, I feel like we just landed our first real punch, and got our first real result. <strong>Now the question is: can we keep fighting?</strong><br/><br/>Reset the Net worked so well. Huge services like Tumblr, Wordpress, and Sendgrid announced new encryption that–thanks to Snowden–we <em>know</em> makes spying harder. Meanwhile, thousands of sites (including Minecraft, one of the world’s most-downloaded games) drove downloads of encrypted calling and texting tools all day on Thursday.<br/><br/>Not a techie? Well, to the NSA, that means our private conversations will increasingly look like this: “I9XJKigrOgyymB1oEtF37xoKDzXuS5NbbRGT5Rq4GA1VCJYC”<br/><br/>The scale of what we’re achieving is just staggering. Sendgrid alone delivers <em>billions</em> of emails each month. Now, those emails are encrypted, safer.<br/><br/><strong>So we can’t stop now, but this is intense work!</strong> Last week was a huge lift for our small team. We think we can get dozens, maybe <em>hundreds</em> more huge sites to step up. But to do it, we&rsquo;ll need a full-time organizer: someone to approach sites, convince them to join, and plan more days of action. <strong>Can you donate to keep Reset the Net going?</strong><br/><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Yes, I’ll donate to a strategy that’s winning against NSA mass surveillance.</strong></a><br/><br/>Our tiny organization is facing a battle on <em>two</em> fronts. We are finally making dents in the NSA’s surveillance system, but meanwhile America’s cable monopolies are attacking the fundamental principles of the open Internet–the ones that make campaigns like this possible. <strong>Alone, either of these would be the fight of our lives. Together, it’s almost more than we can handle.</strong><br/><br/>But we think we can do both, and we have to: each win means so much. Reset the Net was 6 months of work. Now that the campaign structure is in place, we just need to keep adding sites to our roster, and encouraging sites who&rsquo;ve already joined to keep pushing the envelope.<strong> We don’t need expensive design or development help, just one driven full-time organizer.</strong> Someone who can keep nudging this snowball forward, until it becomes an avalanche. Can you pitch in?<br/><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Yes, I’ll donate to a strategy that’s shutting down NSA mass surveillance, piece by piece.</strong></a><br/><br/>This is what victory looks like. Sincerely,<br/><br/>Evan, Holmes, Tiffiniy and the whole Fight for the Future team<br/><br/>P.S. We are serious. If this email goes well we are hiring an organizer right now. Interested? Reply with links to work you’ve done.</p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-4a9dde1b-72d2-7a4a-79de-d5647ebcab66"><span>Hey!</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday was unbelievable. Together, we as everyday Internet users harnessed the power of the largest websites on earth and launched the biggest effort in human history to shut down mass surveillance on the web.</span></p>
<p><span>So how did we do it? Check out this infographic</span><span>. We promise you will end up reading the whole thing and then feeling awesome. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/was-epic-reset-net/" target="_blank">Click here to see how we Reset the Net.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>There’s so much more to tell. We’re still tallying up the numbers and collecting all the amazing stories of how the Internet came together to defend itself.</span></p>
<p><span>And, we’re making the biggest announcement of all.</span><span> Reset the Net was not just a single day of action. We’re going to continue this campaign as a longterm, concerted effort to directly  block dragnet government surveillance from as much of the Internet as we can. </span></p>
<p><span>Each month we’ll be announcing a new wave of participants who are helping Reset the Net, and escalating our demands on the largest tech companies to ensure that they’re taking the most meaningful and concrete steps they possibly can to protect our privacy.</span></p>

<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, Kevin, Vasjen, Jessica<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. None of this would have been possible without the sustaining donations we receive from our members. We need to keep this effort going. </span><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span>Will you please chip in $20 (or more!) today to support our work?</span></a></p>

<p>Hey team,</p>
<p>My fingers are trembling a bit as I type this email — partly from exhaustion but mostly from tremendous excitement. <strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Tomorrow we Reset the Net, and start on a path toward securing the web, and defending freedom for generations to come</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Just today, we received a very special message from Edward Snowden himself. All of us at Fight for the Future are humbled, knowing that our huge victories this year mobilizing against government surveillance would not have been possible without him risking everything to expose the abuses of the worlds’ most powerful governments.</p>
<p>I’m pasting Snowden’s statement in its entirety below. Please forward this email to everyone in your address book, and share this far and wide. These last few hours are critical and we need all hands on deck to push Reset the Net over the edge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org/#splash-screen" target="_blank">Edward Snowden started this, now it’s our turn to be heroes. Proudly display these badges on your sites or social media. You’ll be helping protect everyone who sees your part of the web. </a></strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;One year ago, we learned that the internet is under surveillance, and our activities are being monitored to create permanent records of our private lives — no matter how innocent or ordinary those lives might be.</em></p>
<p><em>Today, we can begin the work of effectively shutting down the collection of our online communications, even if the US Congress fails to do the same. That’s why I’m asking you to join me on June 5th for Reset the Net, when people and companies all over the world will come together to implement the technological solutions that can put an end to the mass surveillance programs of any government. This is the beginning of a moment where we the people begin to protect our universal human rights with the laws of nature rather than the laws of nations.</em></p>
<p><em>We have the technology, and adopting encryption is the first effective step that everyone can take to end mass surveillance. That’s why I am excited for Reset the Net — it will mark the moment when we turn political expression into practical action, and protect ourselves on a large scale.</em></p>
<p><em>Join us on June 5th, and don’t ask for your privacy. Take it back.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Will you stand with Edward Snowden, Fight for the Future, and the largest websites on the Internet to help Reset the Net tomorrow, June 5th?</strong><br/><br/>Please help spread the word by sharing the page on social media:</p>

<p><span><strong>Edward Snowden and Internet&rsquo;s largest websites join Fight for the Future campaign to “Reset the Net” against government mass surveillance</strong> </span></p>
<p><em>Companies, trade groups, consumer organizations and Internet users form growing backlash against government spying programs and move to directly block it on the Internet</em></p>
<p><span>June 5, 2014 &ndash; Fight for the Future and its partners launched Reset the Net today, a national backlash campaign comprised of internet users and tech companies who commit taking back their right to privacy and protecting the Internet by using NSA-resistant privacy tools on their devices, and to take their privacy back &ndash; one user, one cat video, one device at a time. Reset the Net demands that </span><span>web services take concrete steps to protect their users from government snooping, while encouraging the spread of free and open source privacy tools.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been one year since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the U.S. government&rsquo;s abusive spying programs. In that time Congress and the Obama Administration have failed to protect our rights,&rdquo; said Tiffiniy Cheng, spokesperson for Fight for the Future. &ldquo;Now, they&rsquo;ve got a rebellion on their hands as tech companies and internet users work together to directly intervene in mass surveillance and block the NSA and its kind from the web.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Edward Snowden issued a <a href="http://resetthenet.tumblr.com/post/87793640365/edward-snowdens-statement-in-support-of-reset-the-net" target="_blank">statement</a> via his attorney supporting the Reset the Net campaign: </strong></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Today, we can begin the work of effectively shutting down the collection of our online communications&hellip;that’s why I’m asking you to join me on June 5th for Reset the Net, when people and companies all over the world will come together to implement the technological solutions that can put an end to the mass surveillance programs of any government. We have the technology, and adopting encryption is the first effective step that everyone can take to end mass surveillance&hellip;don’t ask for your privacy. Take it back.”</span></p>
<p><span>Cheng continued, &quot;In the last year the public has spoken: mass surveillance is illegitimate. It&rsquo;s fundamentally at odds with democracy. Governments that abuse the Internet to invade our privacy will lose their credibility in the eyes of the world&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>Reset the Net is backed by some of the largest internet companies and advocacy organizations in the world who have committed to taking steps to protect internet users’ privacy, from reddit and Mozilla to Amnesty International and the ACLU, all calling for the integration of basic security features into internet services that will prevent their exploitation, and helping promote a </span><a href="http://pack.resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><span>Privacy Pack</span></a><span> with free, easy-to-use, open source software that all users can use to protect themselves. Internet giant </span><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/transparency-report-protecting-emails.html" target="_blank"><span>Google</span></a><span> made available the source code for End-to-End, a Chrome extension that provides encryption for both sides of an email exchange.</span></p>
<p><span>“Mass surveillance is not inevitable. We believe </span><span>we can make it too expensive and too difficult to bulk collect our data,”</span><span> said Cheng. “</span><span> Starting today, we will turn more and more parts of the Internet into places the NSA and other governments cannot see. Who in Congress is going to ask for more money to take away the human rights that citizens have taken back?&ldquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The Reset the Net website will allow users to pledge their support in trying and sharing privacy tools as well as provide resources that allow for end-to-end encryption of data.</span></p>

</ul><p><strong>Statements from participating companies and organizations supporting Reset the Net</strong></p>
<p><strong>Richard Kirkendall, CEO of Namecheap, said, </strong><span>“Namecheap has a long history of supporting privacy and freedom of expression online. We’ve always worked hard to preserve and protect our customers’ rights. So we’re thrilled to participate in resetting the net in this positive way,”</span></p>
<p><strong>Michael Kieschnick, CEO of CREDO Mobile, said, </strong><span>“It’s been an entire year since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the NSA&rsquo;s unconstitutional and warrantless mass surveillance programs, but Congress and the president still have not reined in the NSA to stop these abuses. Until our government meaningfully reforms its surveillance programs to bring them in line with the 1st and 4th amendments, we will encourage users to adopt encryption tools to protect personal communications.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Erik Martin, General Manager of reddit, said,</strong> </span><span>&ldquo;The Internet is most powerful tool humans have ever had to connect people to information and connect them to each other. The Internet has so much potential to create good in the world and put a dent on some of the big problems in the world, and that&rsquo;s why people are so ferociously motivated to defend it. reddit couldn&rsquo;t operate in a world without freedom of expression, but that&rsquo;s the future that we face if we allow surveillance to continue unchecked. We are proud to have been an early supporter of Reset the Net, and we look forward to doing everything in our power as a company to encourage the use of privacy technology that protects Internet users&rsquo; human rights.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Lee of Private Internet Access said,</strong><span> &ldquo;Privacy is a fundamental human right. Unless we act now, we risk losing everything: our rights, our individuality, our freedom of speech. We have a rare opportunity to turn the tables and restore the Internet to the way it should be. Private Internet Access works every day to make the web a safer place for all, we&rsquo;re proud to help Reset the Net on June 5th.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Tracy Rosenberg, Executive Director of Media Alliance </strong><span><strong>said</strong> “The watering-down of the USA Freedom Act demonstrates that Internet citizens will have to take their online safety and security into their own hands. Reset The Net is a crucial first step in restoring the innovative and creative potential of the Internet.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Felicity Ruby, Internet Policy Director of Thoughtworks, said, </strong><span><strong>“</strong>Given the absence of meaningful government or industry reform one year after the shocking revelations of Edward Snowden, Internet users need to take their own privacy seriously. ThoughtWorks is committed to securing communications - both our own and those of our clients and the general public - from dragnet and illegitimate government mass surveillance and unfettered data mining for commercial purposes. To that end we have begun the development of a secure, encrypted email solution that will be open source software.”</span></p>
<p><strong><strong>Amie Stepanovich, Senior Policy Counsel of Access, said,</strong> </strong>&ldquo;Governments should not be able to treat the internet as a digital panopticon for untargeted, indiscriminate surveillance. One tool for us to prevent this from happening is wide scale adoption of encryption technologies. We applaud the many companies and individuals who are taking steps to cut off unauthorized access to user data, but we can and must do more. We must take back the internet, encrypt all the things, and stop mass surveillance.&rdquo;<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ben Kroetz, Online Director of Greenpeace, said,</strong><span> &ldquo;Greenpeace has learned firsthand during the past 40 years that people cannot protect their right to a clean environment if our civil rights –  including the right to free association and the right to be free of unreasonable searches – are stripped away. A healthy democracy is necessary for a healthy environment, and democracy cannot thrive where a government illegally spies on its citizens as the NSA is doing now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson, Executive Director of OpenMedia.org</strong><span><strong>, said:</strong> “At the end of the day, we’re going to have to create accountability for governments that are spying on their citizens. And it’s sad that people feel they need to route around what their government is doing - this shows just how far governments have grown out of touch with their citizens. It’s so important that people speak out in any way they can about surveillance, and using encryption technologies is one way to do that.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Ethan Oberman, CEO of SpiderOak </strong><span><strong>said</strong> “The Snowden revelations not only raised the level of awareness around privacy but also intrinsically changed the way people think about their online presence. It is wonderful that there is more awareness around this issue and even more wonderful to see the advancements that companies have made in the past year, especially around data encryption. However, privacy on the Internet has been a known problem for a long time, and the solution will not arrive overnight despite public outcries. We are starting to see a shift in the way companies handle user privacy but it will take a while before the Internet as a whole adapts to new privacy standards. In the end, everything evolves and so will our ability to use technology to ensure a greater level of privacy online. And the Snowden leak will forever be a turning point in the conversation and a catalyst around the cause.&ldquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>David Segal, Executive Director of Demand Progress, said, </strong><span>“Demand Progress is committed to fighting for legislative reforms to protect user privacy and our civil liberties. But until those reforms vest &ndash; or if they don&rsquo;t &ndash; the Internet is too important to leave unprotected. We are supporting Reset The Net in order to protect our rights to privacy and to free association. It&rsquo;s time to turn on encryption by default.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Bankston, Policy Director at Open Technology Institute, </strong><span><strong>said,</strong> &quot;The Open Technology Institute is excited to support Reset the Net and highlight the need for all of us – both individual internet users and the companies that serve them – to take full advantage of encryption and other security tools that can help protect our private data against snoops, spies, criminals and creeps.  Strong encryption tools are one of our best defenses against the sort of indiscriminate bulk surveillance that the Snowden revelations have revealed.”</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Josh Levy of Free Press said,</strong> “</span><span>Our right to free expression depends on access to open and secure communications networks. And the NSA&rsquo;s surveillance programs are some of the most serious attacks on these networks — and their users — we&rsquo;ve ever seen. Free Press is proud to have co-founded the StopWatching.Us coalition, which launched one year ago, to lead the fight to restore our rights to connect and communicate in private. Today we&rsquo;re supporting the Reset the Net effort by making a number of changes to our websites to protect users&rsquo; privacy, including the removal of all tracking cookies and beacons. We look forward to continuing the fight against mass surveillance in Congress, in the courts, online and in the streets.”</span></p>
<p><span><strong>John Sullivan, Executive Director, Free Software Foundation, said,</strong> </span><span>&quot;None of the companies or governments fighting to control the Internet treat your freedom and privacy as any priority. Maybe we can make them change over time, but today we can act without their permission to protect ourselves and our networks, using free software they don&rsquo;t control.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>Joseph Lorenzo Hall, Chief Technologist at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology,</strong><span><strong> said,</strong> “Everyone, including app makers, websites, and the public, needs to practice good digital hygiene and take the right steps to protect personal security. Together, we can make it much harder to snoop on our lives online.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Ben Wizner, Director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project</strong><span><strong>, said,</strong> “Americans entrust the most intimate details of their lives to large technology and communications companies. For too long, these companies failed to secure their customers&rsquo; information, leaving it vulnerable to dragnet government surveillance. It&rsquo;s time for that to change. It&rsquo;s time to protect our data, to deploy best-practice security and privacy enhancing technologies, and to ensure that governments everywhere have to knock on the front door – with a court order – rather than sneak in the back door to steal our data.”</span></p>
