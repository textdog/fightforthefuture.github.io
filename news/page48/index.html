        <span class="date">Posted 11:46 EST on February 23, 2015</span>


        <p><br/><i>What a victory for Net Neutrality means for hundreds of millions of Internet users<br/></i><br/>WASHINGTON — Supporters of the open Internet will convene a telephone press conference on Tuesday to set the stage for a momentous week for Net Neutrality. The speakers will include Sen. Edward Markey, former FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, Free Press President and CEO Craig Aaron, Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer, and Center for Media Justice Executive Director Malkia Cyril.<br/><br/>On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to pass strong Net Neutrality rules under Title II of the Communications Act. The Feb. 24
 press call will discuss both this historic vote and two upcoming 
congressional hearings on Net Neutrality. It will feature brief remarks 
from leaders of the Net Neutrality movement followed by a Q&amp;A with 
reporters.<br/><br/>We are at a pivotal moment in the fight for Net 
Neutrality. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has responded to the overwhelming 
public support for strong Title II protections by proposing rules built 
on this legal framework. Since the FCC’s open Internet proceeding began 
in May 2014, a record-breaking 4 million people have submitted comments.
 A vast majority of commenters have urged the FCC to protect Internet 
users’ rights and prevent a few powerful phone and cable companies from 
controlling the future of communications.<br/><br/><b>Here are the details for the call:</b><br/><br/><b>WHAT: </b>Press Teleconference on Net Neutrality, Congress and the FCC<br/><b>WHEN: </b>Tues., Feb. 24, 11:30 a.m. EST<br/><b>CALL-IN NUMBERS: </b>877-876-9175 or 785-424-1668<br/><b>WHO: </b>Craig
 Aaron of Free Press, Evan Greer of Fight for the Future, Rachel 
Colyer of Daily Kos, former FCC Commissioner Michael Copps of Common 
Cause, Malkia Cyril of the Center for Media Justice, Margaret Flowers of
 Popular Resistance, Chris Lewis of Public Knowledge, U.S. Sen. Edward 
Markey, Michael Scurato of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, Sarah 
Morris of the New America Foundation&rsquo;s Open Technology Institute, David 
Segal of Demand Progress, and Michael Winship of Writers Guild of 
America, East<br/><br/><br/></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 10:08 EST on February 20, 2015</span>


        <p><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>February 18, 2015</b></p><p><b>Grassroots Securing Net Neutrality: More Than One Million Calls, Emails to Congress &amp; FCC in 2015</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><i>The numbers send a clear message in support of an open internet to Congress and FCC in advance of Feb. 26 vote</i></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>WASHINGTON, DC</b> – People across the country are taking a strong stand for net neutrality, and
 have generated more than one million actions in  just the first seven 
weeks of 2015. In large numbers, they are emailing, calling, and signing
 petitions to their lawmakers and the FCC. These grassroots actions are 
in addition to the four million comments submitted
 to the FCC in 2014. The massive show of support stands in stark 
contrast to the lobbying and advertising campaigns financed by cable 
giants like Comcast and trade associations like NCTA.
</p><p>A
 diverse coalition of net neutrality supporters— including Color of 
Change, CREDO, Daily Kos, Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, Free 
Press,
<a href="http://MoveOn.org" target="_blank">MoveOn.org</a>, and Mozilla—announced the new numbers today and released the following statement:</p><p>“More
 than one million people have stood up for net neutrality in the last 
seven weeks, which shows how deeply engaged the public is with this 
issue. The public overwhelmingly
 rejects internet fast lanes for the rich and slow lanes for the rest of
 us. 
</p><p>“Congress
 should follow the will of the people and stop trying to interfere with 
the FCC. Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T and NCTA should stop pouring money 
into Congress, false
 ads and lobbyists in their last ditch attempt to undermine the public 
will.”</p><p>A breakdown of the numbers released on today’s call is below:</p><p><b>TOTAL January 1 – February 18, 2015: 1,023,296</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Emails &amp; Petitions to Congress: 716,950</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Calls to Congress: 120,710</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Emails &amp; Petitions to FCC: 75,834</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Emails &amp; Petitions to Others (NCTA, CTIA): 109,802</b></p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:56 EST on February 18, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>February 18, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>WASHINGTON, DC––With just 8 days left until the FCC’s much anticipated net neutrality decision, the Internet is rallying in force to ensure strong protections for free speech Internet freedom. This morning popular online review service Yelp announced their support for Title II reclassification <b><a href="http://officialblog.yelp.com/2015/02/yelp-gives-net-neutrality-five-stars.html" target="_blank">in a blogpost</a></b>, encouraging readers to take action on <b><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleFortheNet.com</a></b> during the <b><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">Internet Countdown</a>. </b></p><p>Meanwhile, organizers announced today that more than <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown/#leadearboard" target="_blank"><b>16,000 websites </b></a>have joined the latest effort by displaying an animated “countdown timer” on their sites, helping drive a daily barrage of thousands of emails and phone calls to Congress. The “countdown” widget has already had more than 14.8 million impressions across the web.</p><p>The Internet Countdown was launched on January 26th, one month before the FCC’s vote. In addition to its latest ally, Yelp, the effort has attracted the support of major web companies and popular startups including <b>Tumblr, Mozilla, MediaFire, Bluehost, BoingBoing, Daily Kos, AdaFruit, Cheezburger, CREDO mobile, and Thunderclap. </b>In addition, the organizers have built online tools making it easy for individual Internet users to participate.</p><p>More than <b>11,000</b> people have signed up to join the<b> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InternetCountdown?src=hash" target="_blank">#InternetCountdown</a></b> “twitter army,” authorizing net neutrality activists to tweet on their behalf regularly between now and the FCC vote. More than<b> 8,500</b> of those people have signed up to tweet every single day until the vote. The total social reach of the twitter army (meaning the combined followers of all the participants) is more than<b> 8.2 million people</b>. </p><p><b>Fight for the Future’s campaign director, Evan Greer, said, </b>“&quot;As the Web literally counts down the seconds to the FCC&rsquo;s historic vote, thousands of websites and hundreds of thousands of Internet users are rising up once again. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn the lesson once and for all: if you want to keep your job, don&rsquo;t mess with the Internet.”</p><p>The Internet Countdown effort was conceived by Fight for the Future, and has been organized in coordination with Demand Progress, Free Press, and the broad coalition behind<b> <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a></b></p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:32 EST on February 10, 2015</span>


        <figure><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_njkgooBOw31ri3xd7.jpg?1506019145203"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>February 10, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>WASHINGTON, DC––Net neutrality activists who support strong free speech protections through Title II reclassification crashed a press conference organized by Republican FCC Commissioner––and former Verizon lawyer––Ajit Pai this morning when they attempted to unfurl a large banner reading “85% of Republican Voters Support Net Neutrality,” a reference to a University of Delaware poll from November, reported in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/12/wonkbook-polling-shows-even-republicans-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>.</p><p><b>Scroll to the bottom of this press release to see more PHOTOS and video</b>. <br/></p><p>FCC security violently attacked the demonstrators, knocking them to the ground. As they were dragged from the room, internet activists Dr. Margaret Flowers and Kevin Zeese of the group PopularResistance.org said, “Commissioner Pai, don&rsquo;t you see Republicans love net neutrality? Stop being a mouthpiece for the Telecoms–your job is to represent the public interest. Title II now! The Internet should be a level playing field for all not one rigged for Comcast and Verizon. No crony capitalism for Comcast and Verizon. Equal access for all.”</p><p>After the activists left the building, FCC security continued to harass them, threatening them with arrest for standing on a public sidewalk offering an interview to a camera crew.</p><p>The action was organized by grassroots activists from the group <a href="http://popularresistance.org" target="_blank">PopularResistance.org</a> with support from the digital rights group <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>. These two groups previously coordinated on the <a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">Occupy the FCC</a> encampment last year that helped put Title II reclassification on the table at the FCC. Fight for the Future were also lead organizers of the September 10th <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> protest along with Demand Progress, and the coalition website they helped build, <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a> was responsible for more than &frac14; of all the comments the FCC received about net neutrality last year. PopularResistance.org has also organized a series of protests and direct actions on this issue, including a civil disobedience action where <a href="https://www.popularresistance.org/breaking-net-neutrality-activists-blockade-fcc-chairman-tom-wheelers-house/" target="_blank">they blockaded</a> FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s driveway.</p><p>Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said, “Net neutrality is not a partisan issue, but corrupt politicians in Washington DC whose campaigns are funded by the Telecom industry are desperate to make it one.” She added, “Given that Republican voters overwhelmingly oppose Internet fast lanes and support the principles of net neutrality, it’s clear that officials like Ajit Pai, who is a former high ranking lawyer for Verizon, are ignoring the public will and working for the industries they’re supposed to be holding accountable.”</p><p>While the action unfolded in Washington, DC today, the battle for the net continued to rage online. Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, Free Press and other groups are organizing a sustained effort called the<b> <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">Internet Countdown</a>,</b> keeping up a constant barrage of online protest between now and the FCC’s vote on February 26th. More than 2,500 sites have joined the effort so far including Bluehost, BoingBoing, Thunderclap, and Daily Kos. Major sites like <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/everybodyontheinternet" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/02/04/victory-for-net-neutrality-lets-take-it-across-the-finish-line/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> are participating with custom landing pages encouraging their users to take action in support of real net neutrality protections through Title II reclassification. More than 6,400 people have signed up to join the countdown by <b><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">automatically tweeting</a> </b>every day between now and the February 26th vote. </p><p>###</p><p><b>Politico reporter Brooks Boliek caught this video: <a href="https://twitter.com/technocowboy/status/565188240505044992" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/technocowboy/status/565188240505044992</a></b><br/></p><p><i>FCC security immediately tackled the activists as soon as they stood up to speak out and hold up the banner. <br/></i></p><figure><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_njkf9ldsZu1ri3xd7.png?1506019145203"/></figure><figure><img src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/17c7395faf4eccf62c7df56b6e97a82b/tumblr_inline_njkgs7L36c1ri3xd7.jpg"/></figure><p><i>FCC security continued to harass the activists even once they were outside on a public sidewalk. </i></p><figure><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_njkgw0oCSE1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019145203"/></figure>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:45 EST on February 5, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>Tumblr, Mozilla, BoingBoing, The Nation, AdaFruit, Daily Kos, CREDO, and more than 2,000 other websites participating in online protests this month. More than 5,000 people have signed up to tweet every day until the FCC’s vote, with a total social reach of more than 5 million people.</i></h2><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>February 5, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:evangreer@gmail.com" target="_blank">evangreer@gmail.com</a></p><p>THE INTERNET––Several of the world’s most popular web companies have re-affirmed their support for online free speech this week by encouraging their users to take action in coordination with the <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">Internet Countdown protest</a>, an effort between websites, Internet users, and grassroots groups to keep up a sustained barrage of phone calls and emails targeting lawmakers in Washington, DC between now and the FCC’s net neutrality vote on February 26th. To amplify the effort, more than 5,000 people used the Internet Countdown <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">twitter tool</a> to signed up to tweet every single day leading up to the decision, with a total social reach of more than 5 million each day.</p><p>The Countdown was launched on January 26th, exactly one month before the FCC’s vote, and has already attracted a number of prominent supporters, and more than 2,000 websites overall. Many websites are creating their own actions geared toward their user base, while dozens of others are using the Internet Countdown’s ready-made “widgets,” which allow any website owner, blogger, or Tumblr user to easily include a “countdown timer” on their site, literally counting down the seconds to the FCC’s vote. Clicking on the widget takes users to <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a>, the net neutrality hub site that was responsible for more than &frac14; of the overall comments that the FCC received during its comment periods.</p><p>This week, blogging platform Tumblr with its more than 220 million blogs unveiled a creative action at <a href="https://tumblr.com/everybodyontheinternet" target="_blank">https://tumblr.com/everybodyontheinternet</a> driving phone calls and emails to Congress in support of Title II net neutrality. On Wednesday, Mozilla, the makers of Firefox, began showing U.S. users of their popular web browser a message encouraging them to take action, and published <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/02/04/victory-for-net-neutrality-lets-take-it-across-the-finish-line/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>. Popular news site BoingBoing is showing users the countdown at the bottom of most articles sitewide. The Nation magazine <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/197193/weve-almost-won-fight-net-neutrality" target="_blank">also joined</a> this week, along with popular DIY electronics site AdaFruit. Social media app Thunderclap is displaying the countdown widget prominently on <a href="http://thunderclap.it" target="_blank">their frontpage</a>. </p><p>“Internet users around the world are celebrating the hard fought victory of getting the FCC chair to come out in support of real net neutrality through Title II reclassification, but they also know that the battle for the net is not over yet,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. She added, “We know that when the Internet comes together for the public interest, nothing is impossible. We will not accept defeat––the Internet will keep fighting until the FCC enacts strong, bright line rules that ban Cable companies from all forms of discrimination, blocking, or throttling of web content.</p><p>“These next few weeks are crucial,” said David Segal, Executive Director of Demand Progress. “Based on what we know now about Chairman Wheeler’s proposal to reclassify broadband Internet under Title II, we have never been closer 
to real net neutrality. But we can’t let up. We need to beat back any 
changes or loopholes in the rules that might weaken them, and we need to
 ensure that Congress does not interfere by advancing proposals that 
would undermine real net neutrality. <b>That’s
 why we’re urging the platforms that benefit from a free and open 
Internet to join us in the Internet Countdown over the next three weeks 
and finish what could be one of the most historic wins for the open Web 
that we’ve ever seen.”</b><br/></p><p>The Internet Countdown is being organized by Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and Free Press, with the support of a broad <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/#teaminternet" target="_blank">#TeamInternet</a> coalition.</p><p>###</p>
