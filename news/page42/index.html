      <h1><a href="/news/2015-05-20-release-hundreds-of-tech-companies-to/">RELEASE: Hundreds of Tech Companies to Congress: TPP and Fast Track Harms Digital Innovation and Users’ Rights</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:43 EDT on May 20, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 20, 2015</p><p>Media Contact:<br/>Evan Greer<br/>Campaign Director, Fight For the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457, Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Maira Sutton<br/>Global Policy Analyst, Electronic Frontier Foundation<br/>Phone: (415) 436 - 9333 x175, Email:  maira@eff.org<br/><br/>In <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and" target="_blank">a joint letter</a> t</b>o Congress released today, more than 250 technology companies and user rights organizations say that the extreme level of secrecy surrounding trade negotiations have led to provisions in agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that threaten digital innovation, free speech, and access to knowledge online, and the letter calls on Congress to come out against the Fast Track (AKA Trade Promotion Authority [TPA]) bill for legitimizing this secretive process. Its signatories include AVG Technologies, DreamHost, Namecheap, Mediafire, Imgur, Internet Archive, BoingBoing, Piwik, Private Internet Access, and many others.<br/></p><p>The letter specifically identifies the TPP&rsquo;s threats based on leaked texts of the agreement—how it threatens fair use, could lead to more costly forms of online copyright enforcement, criminalize whistleblowing and investigative journalism, and create investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) courts that would further jeopardize user protections in domestic laws. The Fast Track bill, the companies write, would legitimize the exclusive process that has led to these and other provisions, as well as undermine lawmakers&rsquo; efforts towards striking the right balance between the interests of copyright holders and those of innovators and users.</p><p>“We simply cannot allow our policymakers to use secret trade negotiations to make digital policy for the 21st century,” <b>said Maira Sutton, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. </b>“Leaks of the TPP agreement have revealed time and time again that this opaque process has led to provisions that undermine our rights to free speech, privacy, and innovation online. The TPP is a huge threat to the Internet and its users. Full stop.”</p><p>“The future of the Internet is simply too important to be decided behind closed doors,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future.</b> “The Fast Track / Trade Promotion Authority process actively silences the voices of Internet users, startups, and small tech companies while giving the biggest players even more power to set policy that benefits a few select companies while undermining the health of the entire Web.”</p><p><b>Harvey Anderson, Chief Legal Officer of the popular anti-virus software company AVG Technologies: </b>&ldquo;The current administration has done much to promote openness and transparency as governance principles and in managing Internet policy, they can, and we expect, that they can do much better than the current Fast Track bill.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Carl Wilcox, CEO of nanotech firm Advanced Surfaces and Processes, Inc.: </b>“Technology companies like us, especially startups and emerging companies, need a level business playing field, not one where mega corporations make the rules and can sue them in a mega-corporation court whose judges and attorneys are all employed by mega-corporations. TPP impacts us negatively when they dictate intellectual property, food safety, the price of prescription drugs, weak environmental, buy local and labor safety rules.”</p><p><b>David Heinemeier Hansson, partner at Basecamp and creator of the popular Ruby on Rails web development framework: </b> “TPP makes a mockery of democratic legislative ideals. It&rsquo;s shrouded in secrecy exactly because it would wither in sunlight. It&rsquo;s a terrible piece of overreach to endow a few special interests with enormous and unsavory power. The whole thing needs to be scrapped and started over. International trade is too important to have it hitched to this collection of wishful thinking by a select few.</p><p><b>Cory Doctorow, author, journalist, and co-editor of Boing Boing: </b>&ldquo;Democracies make their laws in public, not in smoke-filled rooms. If TPP&rsquo;s backers truly believed that they were doing the people&rsquo;s work, they&rsquo;d have invited the people into the room. The fact that they went to extreme, unprecedented measures to stop anyone from finding out what was going on—even going so far as to threaten Congress with jail if they spoke about it —tells you that this is something being done *to* Americans, not *for* Americans.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Founder of the Copia Institute, Mike Masnick: </b>“In the last two decades the Internet has been one of the main drivers of economic growth, progress and prosperity worldwide. And, yet, leaked portions of the TPP agreement and the current fast track bill shows that no one is even considering the impact on the digital economy and digital rights. The TPP and TPA are not designed for an Internet era, or even taking the Internet economy into account. That the whole thing has been written in secret only makes this more concerning over the impact it will have on the most dynamic and important sectors of the economy today.”</p><p><b>For the full letter, visit: <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and</a></b> </p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:07 EDT on May 20, 2015</span>


        <p><i>The following letter was sent to Congress on May 20th by more than 250 technology companies and users’ rights organizations. <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119441457328/release-hundreds-of-tech-companies-to" target="_blank">See the press release here.</a></b> You can see the letter as a PDF </i><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/tech-company-and-user-groups-letter-congress-urging-their-opposition-tpp-fast-track" target="_blank"><b><i>here.</i></b> </a><br/><br/><b>Dear Members of Congress,</b><br/></p><p>We write to you as a community representing thousands of our nation&rsquo;s innovators, entrepreneurs, job-creators, and users to express our concern over trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Despite containing many provisions that go far beyond the scope of traditional trade policy, the public is kept in the dark as these deals continue to be negotiated behind closed doors with heavy influence from only a limited subset of stakeholders.</p><p>The recently-introduced Fast Track bill (the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, “the Bill”) would not remedy the utter lack of transparency of the negotiation process, nor does it include any language to ensure that these deals would contain safeguards to protect our interests in freedom of expression and innovation online. These are just some of our specific concerns we have: </p><p>*    Threats to Fair Use: The TPP contains language that could prevent countries from expanding exceptions and limitations to copyright. The Fast Track Bill also contains nothing to promote balance in copyright law. This is despite how much value fair use has added to the U.S. economy and could add for investors in the growing economies of our trading partners.</p><p>*    Expensive and Harmful Costs of Online Enforcement: U.S. law incentivizes online content providers to take down content over a mere allegation of infringement. The TPP will likely emulate these rules, continuing to make it expensive and onerous for startups and small companies to oversee users’ activities and process each takedown notice.</p><p>*    Criminalizing Journalism and Whistleblowing: TPP’s trade secrets provisions could make it a crime for people to reveal corporate wrongdoing &ldquo;through a computer system.” The language is dangerously vague, and enables signatory countries to enact rules that would ban reporting on timely, critical issues affecting the public.</p><p>*   Investor-State Courts Jeopardize User Protections: The TPP Investment Chapter contains text that would enable corporations to sue nations over democratic rules that allegedly harm expected future profits. Companies can use this process to undermine U.S. rules like fair use, net neutrality, and others designed to protect the free, open Internet and users&rsquo; rights to free expression online.</p><p>Overall, the Bill would legitimize the secret process that has led to these provisions, while doing nothing to ensure that these agreements would enable lawmakers to work towards striking the right balance between the interests of copyright holders and those of users and innovators. As such, we urge you to come out against the Fast Track bill and call on your colleagues in Congress to do the same.</p><p><b>Sincerely,</b></p><p>2b1Inc<br/>ACN Telecommunications &amp; Energy<br/>Adafruit Industries<br/>Advanced Surfaces and Processes Inc.<br/>Airborne Surfer Media<br/>Aldine Publications, LLC <br/>Alpine Travel Services<br/>Archer Law Offices PC<br/>art-efex.com<br/>ArtsDigital.co<br/>Astonishing Legends Productions, LLC<br/>Atlantistechs<br/>Automation Technology, Inc.<br/>Autopia, Ltd<br/>AVG Technologies<br/>Babel Consulting, Inc.<br/>BAGeL Radio<br/>Basecamp<br/>Baumhauerphoto.com<br/>Bay Buys, LLC<br/>Bead &amp; Reel<br/>Bilerico Media LLC<br/>Black Hills Computer Consulting, Inc.<br/>Blue Dog Mobile Marketing<br/>Blue Gothic Design Studios, LLC<br/>BlueTree Website Design<br/>Bohemian Jedi<br/>Boing Boing<br/>Breakwind Farm<br/>Butterflies &amp; Blueberries, Inc<br/>Catalysta LLC<br/>Cell Nation, Inc.<br/>Centerlyne<br/>Cheezburger Network<br/>Chocolate Pocket, LLC<br/>Civic Hall<br/>CoachAccountable, LLC<br/>Codecooler.com<br/>Collaborative Design and Planning<br/>Comatose Podcast<br/>Computer Fix-It<br/>ComputerGiant Consulting, Inc.<br/>Concentric Sky, Inc.<br/>Connect Everywhere LLC<br/>CONTEMPL8 T-SHIRTS LLC<br/>Copia Institute<br/>crasstalk.com<br/>Create Your Health, LLC<br/>CREDO Mobile<br/>CTVotersCount.org<br/>Cultural Circle Poetry Workshops<br/>Curren Media Group<br/>Deskninja Studios LLC<br/>Disconnect<br/>DJs Computers<br/>Dobson Computer Svcs<br/>DreamHost<br/>Duct Tape Programming<br/>eCnet Solutions<br/>Eden Foods<br/>Edison Cimputers, Inc.<br/>Electronic Frontier Foundation<br/>Ellicottville Real Estate<br/>Engineered Fear, LLC<br/>Eric A.

        <span class="date">Posted 16:43 EDT on May 14, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 14, 2015</p><p>Media contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>WASHINGTON––Today the U.S. Senate voted to advance Trade Promotion Authority legislation to “Fast Track” the secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. Digital rights groups, startups, and tech companies condemned the decision, pointing to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/may/08/trans-pacific-partnership-obama-irony" target="_blank"><b>extreme secrecy</b></a> of the trade negotiations process and <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote/#learn" target="_blank"><b>Internet policy provisions</b></a> that would stifle innovation, decrease online privacy, and open the door for global Internet censorship.<br/></p><p>More than 7,500 startups, websites, and tech companies have joined <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank"><b>an online protest </b></a>against the bill, and Internet activists have driven more than 7,000 phone calls and 77,000 emails to Congress in recent weeks. </p><p><b><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>,</b> a leading technology policy nonprofit best known for <a href="http://sopastrike.com" target="_blank">its role</a> in the massive SOPA blackouts and the<b> <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> </b>protest for net neutrality, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p><i>“Today the U.S. Senate put the entire Internet in danger by voting to advance anti-democratic Fast Track legislation for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But fortunately the entire Internet is coming together to sound the alarm, and tens of thousands of concerned netizens are contacting their lawmakers to demand that they stand up for free speech and online privacy by opposing the broken “Fast Track” process and call for the release of the TPP text.</i></p><p><i>The future of the Internet is too important to be decided in secret or through backroom deals and Senate horse-trading. “Fast Track” and the TPP have nothing to do with “free trade.” This obscure and bureaucratic process is being used by industry lobbyists quietly push for extreme policies that the public would never accept if they were proposed openly. </i></p><p><i>This should be clear: any member of Congress who votes for Fast Track / Trade Promotion Authority is voting against the basic rights of every Internet user in the world.

        <span class="date">Posted 18:50 EDT on May 13, 2015</span>


        <p>Earlier today, before USA Freedom went up for a vote on the House floor, Rep. Justin Amash posted this on his Facebook page. USA Freedom has passed the House, reauthorizing key mass surveillance sections of the PATRIOT Act until 2019. As I post his words in full, it feels like posting words that will help to build the anti-surveillance movement and live on into the future for their truth and righteousness.  Those who voted for mass surveillance will be proven wrong. </p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/repjustinamash/posts/891677487538325"> <p>Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the bulk telephone metadata program run by the National Security Agency (NSA) is not authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act and is thus unlawful. The ruling is a big win for privacy and civil liberties advocates who have long argued that Section 215 clearly does not contemplate the type of mass collection we now know is occurring. But the win will be short-lived if H.R. 2048, the latest version of the USA FREEDOM Act that’s scheduled to be considered by the House of Representatives this afternoon, becomes law.
</p><p>
Section 215 authorizes the government to collect records and other “tangible things” that are &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; to a terrorism or foreign intelligence investigation. To support the bulk collection of data pertaining to millions of law-abiding Americans, the government has effectively claimed that all records everywhere are potentially relevant to a current or future investigation, and thus all records are fair game for collection. In its ruling, the Second Circuit had little choice but to reject the government&rsquo;s broad interpretation of &ldquo;relevant,&rdquo; given that the rest of the statute gives no indication Congress ever contemplated collection on such a mass scale.
</p><p>
So far, so good.
</p><p>
But H.R. 2048 threatens to undo much of the progress resulting from the Second Circuit’s opinion. The bill&rsquo;s sponsors, and unfortunately some outside advocacy groups, wrongly claim that H.R. 2048 ends &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; collection. It&rsquo;s true that the bill ends the phone dragnet as we currently know it—by having the phone companies themselves hold, search, and analyze certain data at the request of the government, which is worse in many ways given the broader set of data the companies hold—but H.R. 2048 actually expands the statutory basis for the large-scale collection of most data.
</p><p>
H.R. 2048 does this by authorizing the government to order the production of records based upon a “specific selection term” (i.e., like a search term used in a search engine). The records sought still must be relevant to an investigation, so it’s possible the court’s ruling will continue to restrain the government in some fashion. But it’s more likely a court looking at H.R. 2048’s language will see the “specific selection term” as defining the outer limits of what Congress considers acceptably “relevant” under Section 215.
</p><p>
Indeed, the Second Circuit encouraged Congress in reforming Section 215 to make a “congressional judgment as to what is ‘reasonable’ under current circumstances.” Unfortunately, “specific selection term” is defined so broadly under the bill as to have little effect on narrowing the scope of items the government may obtain through a 215 order.

A “specific selection term” may be a specific person (including a corporation, such as Western Union), account, address, or personal device, but it also may be “any other specific identifier,” and the bill expressly contemplates using geographic regions or communication service providers (such as Verizon) to define the records sought, so long as it&rsquo;s not the only identifier used as part of the specific selection term. In other words, the bill doesn&rsquo;t let the government require Verizon to turn over all its records without limitation, but nothing appears to prevent the government from requiring Verizon to turn over all its records for all its customers in the state of New York. Only a politician or bureaucrat wouldn&rsquo;t call that &ldquo;bulk.&rdquo;

H.R. 2048 gives our intelligence agencies, for the first time, statutory authority to collect Americans’ data in bulk. In light of the Second Circuit’s opinion that the NSA has been collecting our information in bulk without statutory authority for all this time, it would be a devastating misstep for Congress to pass a bill that codifies that bulk collection and likely ensures no future court will ever again be positioned to rule against the government for over-collecting on statutory grounds.
</p><p>
H.R. 2048 falls woefully short of reining in the mass collection of Americans’ data, and it takes us a step in the wrong direction by specifically authorizing such collection in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Americans, and members of Congress, should demand that Congress instead pass the original, bipartisan version of the USA FREEDOM Act from 2013, which strengthened—not weakened—Section 215’s relevance standard to end bulk collection, while still allowing the government the flexibility it needs to pursue genuine threats against the United States.</p></blockquote>

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-05-13-awesome-statement-from-rep-justin-amash-about-why/">Awesome statement from Rep Justin Amash about why the USA Freedom Act doesn’t end bulk NSA collection</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 18:49 EDT on May 13, 2015</span>


        <p>We’re not in the habit of copying and pasting statements from politicians, but this one is pretty bad-ass and breaks down an important and complex issue.</p><p><b>The statement below is copied from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/repjustinamash/posts/891677487538325" target="_blank">Rep Justin Amash’s Facebook page. </a></b></p><p>Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the bulk telephone metadata program run by the National Security Agency (NSA) is not authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act and is thus unlawful. The ruling is a big win for privacy and civil liberties advocates who have long argued that Section 215 clearly does not contemplate the type of mass collection we now know is occurring. But the win will be short-lived if H.R. 2048, the latest version of the USA FREEDOM Act that’s scheduled to be considered by the House of Representatives this afternoon, becomes law.</p><p>Section 215 authorizes the government to collect records and other “tangible things” that are &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; to a terrorism or foreign intelligence investigation. To support the bulk collection of data pertaining to millions of law-abiding Americans, the government has effectively claimed that all records everywhere are potentially relevant to a current or future investigation, and thus all records are fair game for collection. In its ruling, the Second Circuit had little choice but to reject the government&rsquo;s broad interpretation of &ldquo;relevant,&rdquo; given that the rest of the statute gives no indication Congress ever contemplated collection on such a mass scale.</p><p>So far, so good.</p><p>But H.R. 2048 threatens to undo much of the progress resulting from the Second Circuit’s opinion. The bill&rsquo;s sponsors, and unfortunately some outside advocacy groups, wrongly claim that H.R. 2048 ends &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; collection. It&rsquo;s true that the bill ends the phone dragnet as we currently know it—by having the phone companies themselves hold, search, and analyze certain data at the request of the government, which is worse in many ways given the broader set of data the companies hold—but H.R. 2048 actually expands the statutory basis for the large-scale collection of most data.</p><p>H.R. 2048 does this by authorizing the government to order the production of records based upon a “specific selection term” (i.e., like a search term used in a search engine). The records sought still must be relevant to an investigation, so it’s possible the court’s ruling will continue to restrain the government in some fashion. But it’s more likely a court looking at H.R. 2048’s language will see the “specific selection term” as defining the outer limits of what Congress considers acceptably “relevant” under Section 215.</p><p>Indeed, the Second Circuit encouraged Congress in reforming Section 215 to make a “congressional judgment as to what is ‘reasonable’ under current circumstances.” Unfortunately, “specific selection term” is defined so broadly under the bill as to have little effect on narrowing the scope of items the government may obtain through a 215 order.</p><p>A “specific selection term” may be a specific person (including a corporation, such as Western Union), account, address, or personal device, but it also may be “any other specific identifier,” and the bill expressly contemplates using geographic regions or communication service providers (such as Verizon) to define the records sought, so long as it&rsquo;s not the only identifier used as part of the specific selection term. In other words, the bill doesn&rsquo;t let the government require Verizon to turn over all its records without limitation, but nothing appears to prevent the government from requiring Verizon to turn over all its records for all its customers in the state of New York.
