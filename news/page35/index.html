      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-15-breaking-trade-group-representing-google/">BREAKING: Trade group representing Google, Facebook, Yahoo, T-Mobile, Sprint, & Netflix, says that it does not support CISA, controversial cyber bill</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:05 EDT on October 15, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 15, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-,6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>This morning, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group that represents many large technology companies including Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/2015/10/ccia-urges-senate-to-improve-cybersecurity-information-sharing-act/" target="_blank">published a blog post</a> saying they do not support the current version of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA.)<br/></p><p>“[CISA] does not sufficiently protect users’ privacy or appropriately limit the permissible uses of information shared with the government,” the post read, “In addition, the bill authorizes entities to employ network defense measures that might cause collateral harm to the systems of innocent third parties &hellip;  such a system should not come at the expense of users’ privacy, need not be used for purposes unrelated to cybersecurity, and must not enable activities that might actively destabilize the infrastructure the bill aims to protect.”</p><p>CCIA <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/about/members/" target="_blank">represents</a> a wide range of large technology companies including: Amazon, British Telecom, Cloudflare, Dish, eBay, Facebook, Foursquare, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Pandora, Paypal, Samsung, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Yahoo.</p><p>“Internet users are outraged that Congress is even considering legislation that undermines the basic security of the Internet by sweeping away privacy protections and letting companies off the hook when they improperly share or leak our personal information,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future,</b> “Members of Congress should pay attention: nobody wants this bill. Not the public, not security experts, and not even the industry it’s supposed to protect. The safety of Internet users personal information is more fragile than ever, if Congress decides to make matters worse, everyone will know it was the result of ignorance and corruption”</p><p>This new host of companies coming out against the current version of CISA is a major blow to the already teetering legislation. It is particularly notable that T-Mobile is a member of CCIA, as the sponsors of CISA have attempted to use the recent <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/130360813438/fight-for-the-future-calls-for-experian-ceo-to" target="_blank">T-Mobile / Experian</a> information breach as an excuse to push the bill to the Senate floor, even though cybersecurity <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151008/17085132483/why-do-senators-keep-lying-about-what-cisa-would-be-used.shtml" target="_blank">experts say</a> CISA would have done nothing to prevent it. </p><p>Last month, the Business Software Alliance, which represents Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, Salesforce, and others, clarified that <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">it does not support CISA</a> after Fight for the Future launched a campaign calling out companies that had <a href="http://www.bsa.org/~/media/Files/Policy/Data/09142015CongLeadershipDataAgendaLetter.pdf" target="_blank">signed a letter</a> that appeared to support CISA-like legislation. </p><p>The <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">YouBetrayedUs.org</a> campaign sparked a major backlash from customers and Internet users, generating thousands of emails to the companies involved, and online calls for a boycott, which quickly lead to Salesforce’s CEO <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/129854286868/breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo" target="_blank">taking to twitter</a> to say that his company does not support the bill and the original BSA letter was “a mistake.”</p><p>Technology companies and members of Congress are under increasing pressure to oppose CISA, which has now been delayed multiple times in the Senate after grassroots uprisings. Fight for the Future and other groups are planning to escalate their efforts targeting both Congress and technology companies that remain silent or support CISA, and will be ready if the bill comes before the Senate in the coming weeks.</p><p>###</p>

        <h2><i>Digital rights group Fight for the Future calls for Congress to Defund the corrupt U.S Trade Representative (USTR) in response to leaked text</i></h2><p>This morning, Wikileaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp-ip3/" target="_blank">released</a> the final negotiated text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) “Intellectual Property” chapter, confirming advocates warnings that the deal contains extreme copyright provisions and monopoly protections for large pharmaceutical companies that threaten online freedom of speech and affordable access to medicine.</p><p><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, a leading digital rights group that has opposed the TPP due to its utter lack of transparency and potential to lead to widespread Internet censorship, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;The text of the TPP&rsquo;s intellectual property chapter confirms advocates warnings that this deal poses a grave threat to global freedom of expression and basic access to things like medicine and information. </i></p><p><i>But the sad part is that no one should be surprised by this. It should have been obvious to anyone observing the process that this would be the result.  Appointed government bureaucrats and monopolistic companies were given more access to the text than elected officials and journalists; from the outset there was no way this was going to be a good deal for the public&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Honestly, at this point, the only true course of action for members of Congress who still believe in democracy would be to completely defund and do away with the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR,) who are largely responsible for the TPP and its extremist contents. This agency become the laughing stock of Washington, DC and is one of the most blatant examples of a revolving door between industry and government. The contents of the TPP&rsquo;s IP chapter were bought and paid for by Hollywood and the pharmaceutical industry before the negotiations even began.</i></p><p><i>The U.S.’s copyright system is corrupt and severely broken. But instead of trying to fix it, the USTR is trying to force these draconian policies on the rest of the world. We at Fight for the Future will fight to make sure that never happens, and we call upon the entire Internet to fight with us.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit that has driven more than 130,000 emails and more than 15,000 phone calls to Congress opposing the TPP  in recent months, rallied more than 7,500 websites for an <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank">online protest</a>, and helped coordinate <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/20/hundreds-tech-companies-oppose-tpp-trade-agreement" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Congress from more than 250 tech companies expressing transparency and tech related concerns about Fast Track legislation.</p><p>The group made headlines in March when they <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wydenblimp/" target="_blank">flew a 30’ blimp</a> over several of Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings calling for him to “Save the Internet” by opposing Fast Track for the TPP, and then <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/115053188968/internet-activists-call-out-ron-wyden-over-fast" target="_blank">parked a Jumbotron</a> on capitol hill to display <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">the viral video</a> they made about the stunt.

        <span class="date">Posted 12:10 EDT on October 5, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 5, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>This morning, government officials reported that the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has been “finalized” after a weekend of closed-door meetings in Atlanta. <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, a leading digital rights group that has opposed the deal due to its lack of transparency and extreme copyright provisions that could lead to Internet censorship, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to Campaign Director, Evan Greer:<br/></p><p><i>“Government bureaucrats have emerged from their secret meetings claiming they’ve finalized the TPP text, but it’s anything but a done deal. For the Trans-Pacific Partnership to become law, it must first be accepted by each individual country’s elected officials, including U.S. Congress, where it faces fierce resistance from both political parties.<br/><br/>The TPP is a wishlist for monopolistic corporations that inherently benefits giant multinational companies while undermining small businesses and startups. Based on the latest leaks, the TPP contains extreme copyright provisions that will stifle innovation, harm the tech economy, and worst of all, threaten our basic rights to self-expression by paving the way for widespread Internet censorship.<br/></i></p><p><i>The future of the Internet is far too important to be decided in an agreement that has been negotiated entirely behind closed doors. The public outcry is already rising, but in the coming weeks we will amplify it tenfold. The Internet has proven its ability to defend itself time and time again. U.S. lawmakers are in the spotlight now, and they should know that the public is watching them closely and overwhelmingly expects them to vote down this terrible deal.”</i></p><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit that has driven more than 130,000 emails and more than 15,000 phone calls to Congress in recent months, rallied more than 7,500 websites for an <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank">online protest</a>, and helped coordinate <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/20/hundreds-tech-companies-oppose-tpp-trade-agreement" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Congress from more than 250 tech companies expressing transparency and tech related concerns about Fast Track legislation.</p><p>The group made headlines in March when they <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wydenblimp/" target="_blank">flew a 30’ blimp</a> over several of Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings calling for him to “Save the Internet” by opposing Fast Track for the TPP, and then <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/115053188968/internet-activists-call-out-ron-wyden-over-fast" target="_blank">parked a Jumbotron</a> on capitol hill to display <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">the viral video</a> they made about the stunt.

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-02-fight-for-the-future-calls-for-experian-ceo-to/">Fight for the Future calls for Experian CEO to resign over CISA lobbying after massive data breach</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 18:09 EDT on October 2, 2015</span>


        <p>I’m sure you’ve seen the news about the massive data breach at Experian that has exposed more than 15 million T Mobile customers’ sensitive data.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Today, Fight for the Future responded by launching a petition calling for Experian’s CEO to resign: <a href="https://www.youbetrayedus.org/experian" target="_blank">https://www.youbetrayedus.org/experian</a></b></p><p>Experian has been hacked <a href="http://www.databreaches.net/the-complaint-to-ftc-about-experian-that-accomplished-what/" target="_blank">more than 100 times</a>, but instead of improving their inadequate digital security, they are spending money lobbying Congress to pass CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, a bill that may give companies like them legal immunity in the event of a hack, as long as they share data with the government.</p><p>Ironically, earlier today we noticed the page where Experian is directing customers who have been affected by the hack, ProtectmyID.com/securityincident, was not protected by basic HTTPS encryption. We <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/650038390675636224" target="_blank">tweeted about it</a>, and a few hours later the site now appears to be protected by HTTPS.</p><p>This is a perfect example of the flawed underlying logic behind CISA. Instead of encouraging companies like Experian to improve their deeply flawed security practices, this bill could offer them legal immunity, allowing them to shift blame to the government and giving them no incentive to secure their own networks. </p><p>Fight for the Future CTO Jeff Lyon said, &ldquo;Experian CTO Brian Cassin has put the profits of his company above the well-being of his customers and our nation&rsquo;s cybersecurity. Why should Experian bother fixing their security when they can just lobby their way out of the messes they make? This type of thinking is putting millions of people at risk. Cassin should resign and companies like Experian and T Mobile should take responsibility for the safety their customer’s data.&rdquo; </p><p>Earlier today, Senator’s Burr and Feinstein issued <a href="https://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/as-major-hack-exposes-another-15-million-people-intel-chairs-burr-and-feinstein-call-for-passage-of-cyber-bill-" target="_blank">a statement</a> regarding the T Mobile breach where they used the news to encourage Congress to pass CISA. Their logic could not possibly be more flawed. We should be holding companies with negligent data practices accountable, not offering them legal immunity when they share data with government agencies who also have a terrible track record of protecting it. </p><p>Feel free to reach out to us for additional comments on the T Mobile / Experian breach and how it relates to cybersecurity legislation pending in Congress. </p><p>Contact: press@fightforthefuture.org </p>
