        <span class="date">Posted 03:42 EDT on May 23, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 23, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p><h2>Internet Activists Celebrate Historic Departure from Patriot Act Status Quo</h2><p><b><i>After 40+ &ldquo;Sunset&rdquo; vigils across the country, millions of emails, hundreds of thousands of phone calls to Congress, and tens of thousands of websites protesting, Congress rejected two attempts to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act early Saturday morning</i></b></p><p>WASHINGTON––The United States Senate has rejected two surveillance bills that would have reauthorized expiring sections of the Patriot Act &ndash; either carte blanche for two months or in an updated form until 2019. Congress has been faced with how to address the bulk collection of data after these programs were revealed by Edward Snowden, and since studies of these programs have shown they have had a negligible effect on thwarting terrorism cases. </p><p>Fight for the Future, the prominent digital rights group best known for their role in the massive SOPA and net neutrality protests, and the <a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><b>Reset the Net</b></a> campaign, which was<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/edward-snowden-privacy-reset-the-net" target="_blank"> <b>endorsed</b></a> by Edward Snowden, celebrated the victory. The group helped organize dozens of “<a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119583384473/protesters-gather-in-dozens-of-cities-to-call-for" target="_blank">Sunset Vigils”</a> across the U.S. on Thursday <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119583384473/protesters-gather-in-dozens-of-cities-to-call-for" target="_blank">(see photos here)</a>.</p><p>Fight for the Future and many other privacy groups <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/242736-no-congress-did-not-just-vote-to-end-nsa-spying" target="_blank"><b>had criticized</b></a> the USA Freedom Act, a bill that would have reauthorized some of the worst sections of the PATRIOT Act without meaningfully curtailing government spying. The group’s representatives issued the following statements about today’s historic victory:</p><p>&ldquo;Sunsetting the Patriot Act is the biggest win for ending mass surveillance programs, and one that conventional DC wisdom said was impossible. We are seeing history in the making and it was because the public stood up for our rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association – and there&rsquo;s no turning back now,&rdquo; <b>said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future. </b></p><p>According to a<b> <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/obama-admin-nsa-spying-will-begin-shutting-down-this-week-20150520" target="_blank">White House memo to Congress</a></b>, the Senate’s failure to renew provisions of the PATRIOT Act means that the NSA must begin shutting down its domestic mass surveillance programs this week, possibly only temporarily.</p><p>“These bills were an attempt to disregard the abuses revealed by Snowden and cement mass surveillance into law in defiance of the Constitution, the courts, and public sentiment,” <b>said Jeff Lyon, CTO of Fight for the Future.</b> “The failure of these bills to pass shows just how dramatically the politics of surveillance changed once the extent of the government’s surveillance programs became known to the public.” </p><p>“It was like Congress had some sick fetish for George Orwell jokes, or couldn’t wait for the next Hunger Games to come out,” <b>said Fight for the Future co-founder, Holmes Wilson,</b> “They were about to reauthorize spying on the emails and calls of every American with a bill called ‘USA Freedom!’&quot;</p><p>&ldquo;Congress got a pass before, because we didn&rsquo;t know for sure that the US government was illegally interpreting our laws to conduct mass surveillance programs. But, now that these programs have seen the light of day, they&rsquo;re responsible for enacting mass surveillance into law or discontinuing it,&rdquo; <b>added Cheng.</b> &ldquo;Some members of Congress are now on record for voting against the Constitution, 240 years of legislative intent, and the public will of the last hundred years, and for mass surveillance programs.&rdquo;  </p><p>###</p>

It’s time we come together and let the sun go down on this dark age of government surveillance. Together we will end the PATRIOT Act, and the sun can rise on a new day filled with freedom and privacy for all.”</p><p>“Just a few weeks ago an expiration of 215 of any length seemed impossible, but hundreds of thousands have spoken out and upended conventional inside-the-Beltway wisdom”<b> said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress. </b> “More than 13 years since the Patriot Act’s passage, and after craven abuse of Section 215 and other authorities, we are reminded why sunsets are written into bills like this: It is time for the intelligence agencies to answer for their violations of the public trust.”</p><p>“The PATRIOT Act, passed when the nation was in shock from the September 11 attacks, was never meant to be permanent. That&rsquo;s why sunset was written into the law,”<b> said Becky Bond, Vice President of CREDO Mobile. </b>“Our surveillance agencies have gone rogue, and sunsetting the PATRIOT Act – even if just for a few days – would be the first real step Congress has taken toward ending unconstitutional spying on Americans,” <b>Bond continued.</b><br/></p><p>““The NSA got caught with its hand in the cookie jar”,<b> said Alex Marthews, national chair of Restore The Fourth. </b>“The security agencies have been misusing the PATRIOT Act in order to spy on us all. Explain to me why we should let them keep doing it, instead of confining them to their real job: Spying on actual criminals and actual agents of foreign powers?”</p><p>“The balance between national security and civil liberties has been out of whack for more than a decade,&ldquo; s<b>aid Free Press Action Fund Government Relations Manager Sandra Fulton. </b>&quot;People have had enough of government efforts to spy on all aspects of our lives. The nationwide sunset vigils have sent a signal to Washington: It&rsquo;s time we closed this chapter on mass surveillance and restored everyone&rsquo;s rights to connect and communicate in private.&rdquo;</p><p>###</p><p><b>See a full gallery of photos at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/iDSvA" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/iDSvA</a></b></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="337" data-orig-width="599"><img src="https://36.media.tumblr.com/12c370db5a93784fd4360152b00769d5/tumblr_inline_nor97eicPi1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="337" data-orig-width="599"/></figure><p>New York City, NY</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="683"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/5cb8823463bdb1f5e71405ff266a35f5/tumblr_inline_nor97uZjpq1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="683"/></figure><p>Washington, DC</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="683" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/19498a45c226059ace140eaa4c987036/tumblr_inline_nor98eNyAK1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="683" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>Minneapolis, MN</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="450" data-orig-width="600"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/b657b1892641ee5a3dac2ced04a0058a/tumblr_inline_nor98vrt721ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="450" data-orig-width="600"/></figure><p>Washington, DC</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="450" data-orig-width="600"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/54cd660aaad191230f94d651bc3c2fa8/tumblr_inline_nor99lm43A1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="450" data-orig-width="600"/></figure><p>Chicago, IL</p>

These motions on the reauthorization bills will require 60 votes to be approved, and that seems unlikely at this point. If they do somehow get 60 votes, a final vote won’t happen until Wednesday of next week. </p><p>But here’s the thing. All bills have to go through both the Senate and the House of Representatives before they can become law, and the House is leaving for vacation today until after the Patriot Act section expires. The House has already <a href="https://medium.com/@donnydonny/follow-the-money-usa-freedom-act-backers-in-congress-have-taken-more-than-twice-as-much-money-8e1f59d6be61" target="_blank">passed the USA Freedom Act</a>, which renews the Patriot Act, so the only real way for Congress to stop a sunset at this point is for the Senate to pass that bill. </p><p>Our <a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#congress" target="_blank">vote count</a> shows that the Senate doesn’t have the votes to pass it, so if we can prevent a few on-the-fence Senators from siding with the NSA on this, we will be going back to a world where law enforcement and Intelligence officials need to actually get a warrant to spy on us. </p><p>At that point, if Congress wants to bring back the ability for the government to spy on us without a warrant they will need to affirmatively re-legislate the PATRIOT Act. It won’t be just a matter of extending sunset dates anymore. Every member of Congress will have to go down on the record saying they don’t want the government to have to seek a warrant to spy on us, which is a very unpopular position and something that <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/09/64_percent_of_911_legislators.php" target="_blank">2/3rds</a> of the House of Representatives have never had to vote on. </p><p>We are so close to an epic win on mass surveillance. That’s why we’re hosting sunset vigils across the country this evening at senators’ local offices to call on the Patriot Act to expire. <br/></p><p>If you want this win; If you want the government to have to get a warrant before they can spy on you, your communications, and your family, Join us tonight. </p><p><b><a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#protest" target="_blank">Find a local Sunset the Patriot Act vigil here. </a></b></p>
