        <span class="date">Posted 13:57 EDT on May 14, 2014</span>


        <p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 14, 2014</span></p>
<p><span>MEDIA CONTACTS:<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org<br/>Margaret Flowers - 410-591-0892<br/>Kevin Zeese: 301-996-6582<br/>Kevin Huang: 510-648-5048<br/>Evan Greer: 978-852-6457</span></p>
<p><span><strong>FCC Chair Tom Wheeler comes out of FCC building to meet with net neutrality protesters who have been camped out on his doorstep since May 7th. Events planned tomorrow in more than 20 cities.</strong> </span></p>
<p><em>Activists from Popular Resistance and Fight for the Future tell the Chairman that the only path toward lasting net neutrality is reclassifying the Internet as a common carrier to protect it in the public interest</em></p>
<p><em><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n5ksmph4sE1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019148571"/></em></p>
<p><span><strong>WASHINGTON, DC</strong> &ndash; This morning at 10:00am net neutrality protesters saw further evidence of the impact of grassroots organizing as FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler came out to meet with the <a href="http://fight4future.tumblr.com/post/85622318333/press-release-net-neutrality-activists-occupy-the" target="_blank">Occupy the FCC encampment </a>which has surrounded the FCC headquarters in Washington, DC with tents, protest signs, and banners since May 7th.</span></p>
<p><span>He was followed later by Commissioner Mignon Clyburn. This means a majority of the five commissioners have visited the encampment to talk with protesters.  On Friday, Ajit Pai meet with the protesters.</span></p>
<p><span>Activists from Occupy the FCC say they are glad that the FCC has been responding to public pressure, but won’t be satisfied until the agency takes meaningful action. The encampment will continue until after the FCC proposal is announced tomorrow. A variety of organizations have called for simultaneous gatherings at FCC buildings in more than 20 U.S. cities tomorrow, May 15th at 12:00noon.  After tomorrow, the groups pledge to escalate their organizing to mobilize people to shape the future of the Internet as an open, democratic tool with equal access to all &ndash; real net neutrality.</span></p>
<p><strong>Below are quotes from organizers of Occupy the FCC in response to Tom Wheeler’s remarks at the camp. Please contact us if you’d like to schedule an interview with one of the activists who spoke with the Chairman.</strong></p>
<p><span>“It is great that Wheeler came to the encampment to talk with us but he is still in favor of a solution that will not work,” </span><strong>said Kevin Zeese of PopularResistance.org, who has been camped out at the FCC since May 7th.</strong><span> “Section 706 does not give the FCC the authority it needs to ensure real Net Neutrality protections. This approach has lost in court twice. The only reason he will not take the approach necessary, reclassifying the Internet as a common carrier, is because the mega-telecom companies &ndash; whom he used to work for &ndash; do not want it.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We want the Chairman to understand that we won&rsquo;t settle for anything less than making the last mile of the Internet net neutral,” </span><strong>said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of FIght for the Future.</strong><span> “Chairman Wheeler, saying that you promise to keep pre-peer  ‘open,’ meaning according to your rules that there will be fast and slow lanes, is obviously not enough. The only way to ensure that we have a net neutral Internet is to reclassify under Title II.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Wheeler came to the encampment because public pressure is mounting,”</span><strong> added Margaret Flowers also of PopularResistance.org</strong><span><strong>,</strong> “We have gotten strong media coverage, not only in the online community, but in Time Magazine, the Washington Post and other corporate media outlets. He has backtracked from his initial proposal &ndash; that would have ended net neutrality and set up a tiered Internet based on fees &ndash; because of public pressure. He has received more than a million emails favoring net neutrality as well as thousands of phone calls while our encampment has been growing on his doorstep. It is going to take escalating public pressure to respond to the telecom giants who will be fighting the public interest every step of the way.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Huang of Fight for the Future, who was also at the encampment when Wheeler visited, said,</strong><span> “Wheeler is speeding towards the quickest solution by proposing rules instead of structural change through reclassification. His plan is a bandaid that can easily be peeled off  by the courts or the next chair. The people want the Internet to be returned to its original status as a common carrier so that the FCC has real power to represent the public&rsquo;s interest against telecom giants and the public has a mechanism for accountability.”</span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n5kyp9tseW1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019148571"/></p>

<p><br/><span>“Wheeler was forced to come to the camp at Occupy the FCC because it is growing and the majority of the public, FCC employees, tech companies and media are united in their support for returning the Internet to common carrier status,” </span><strong>Margaret Flowers concluded. </strong><span>“Now what we need is action, not photo ops. Let’s open this debate up to the people in a public forum. We say “no” to backroom deals with industry giants.”</span></p>

<p><strong>“Occupy the FCC” encampment gathers support from tech companies and advocacy groups as net neutrality protesters surround FCC headquarters with tents and banners</strong></p>
<p><em>Unsatisfied with backpedaling and empty promises from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, activists are camped out day and night on the agency’s doorstep demanding the Internet be reclassified as a common carrier</em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash; This morning, and every morning since last Wednesday, FCC employees were greeted on their way in to work by a dedicated group of net neutrality activists who are camped out on the agency’s doorstep with tents, signs, and a giant banner reading, “Don’t Break the Internet!” Many FCC employees have expressed their support to the demonstrators, who have distributed hundreds of flyers to people entering FCC headquarters.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/96688/net-neutrality-plan-in-chaos/" target="_blank"><span>TIME Magazine reports</span></a><span>: &ldquo;The FCC’s eighth floor executive office has been thrown into chaos amid a mounting backlash that shut down its phone lines as a growing number of Open Internet advocates camp out in front of their office.&rdquo; </span><span></span></p>

<p><span>The encampment was sparked last week by activists from Fight for the Future and PopularResistance.org and is growing steadily, gaining support today from major tech companies including CREDO Mobile and reddit as well as advocacy groups Demand Progress, MoveOn.org, OpenMedia, and Free Press. </span></p>
<p><span>Organizers at Occupy the FCC promise escalation of their protests and have several events planned this week including a concert and open mic Tuesday night and an art-making party on Wednesday night. The week-long protest will culminate during </span><strong><a href="http://act.freepress.net/survey/DC_May_15/" target="_blank">a rally</a></strong><span> on May 15th organized by a diverse range of organizations. The protest comes after a month of intense online action during which millions of people emailed, called, or signed petitions to the FCC demanding that protect net neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re here at the FCC night and day because the future of the Internet is being decided in this building &ndash; and the open web is too important to our democracy for us to remain silent,” </span><strong>said Kevin Huang of Fight for the Future</strong><span>, “We won’t be fooled by Tom Wheeler’s empty promises. There is only one clear path forward for for real net neutrality: the FCC must reclassify the Internet as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act. Anything less is just ‘net neutrality’ in air quotes.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Camping out here on FCC’s doorstep, it is so clear that the influence that corporate lobbyists have had over this building is starting to crumble,” </span><span>s<strong>aid Margaret Flowers of PopularResistance.org</strong></span><strong>, who has been camped out at the FCC since May 7th. </strong><span>“We have had many FCC employees stop by our camp to express their support, and more people and tents are showing up every day from all over the country. If Tom Wheeler sticks with his buddies at AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast, he will soon find out that they are the only friends he has. If Wheeler is unable to put the public interest before his colleagues in industry maybe it is time for Wheeler to resign.”</span></p>
<p><span>“The public outcry over Tom Wheeler’s proposal to allow for discrimination on the Internet has become impossible to ignore” </span><strong>said Becky Bond, Political Director of CREDO Mobile, </strong><span>“More and more, people depend on the Internet to meet their basic needs. The FCC needs to treat the web as what it is: a public utility that should be protected in the public interest.”<br/>Here are some photos of the encampment. <a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">Click here for more.</a><br/></span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:58 EDT on March 20, 2014</span>


        <p class="c0"><span>More than 25 leading tech companies and start-ups have joined a public letter urging Senator Ron Wyden, the newly appointed Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, </span><span>to firmly oppose any form of “fast track” authority for trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and to demand transparency and an opportunity for public participation in negotiations that affect Internet freedom, free speech, and the tech economy. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c4"><a class="c5" href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/letter" target="_blank">Click here to see the</a></span><span class="c2 c4"><a class="c5" href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/letter" target="_blank"> full letter signed by more than 25 tech companies.</a></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n2qv98mgV61sor4zo.png?1506019148572"/></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The signatories include well known tech companies like reddit, Automattic (WordPress.com), Imgur, DuckDuckGo, CREDO Mobile, BoingBoing, Thoughtworks, Namecheap, Fark, iFixit, and Cheezburger</span><span>.</span><span> Collectively, these companies represent the interests of millions of users in the United States and around the world. In the letter, the companies outline how the technology industry, from entrepreneurs and engineers all the way to consumers, could be harmed by “fast tracked” trade agreements that contain unbalanced copyright and innovation policy frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>“These highly secretive, </span><span>supranational </span><span>agreements are reported to include provisions that vastly expand on any reasonable definition of ‘trade,’ including provisions that impact patents, copyright, and privacy in ways that constrain legitimate online activity and innovation,” the companies write. The letter continues: “Our industry, and the users that we serve, need to be at the table from the beginning,” which has not been the case with TPP negotiations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><strong>Meanwhile, in Portland, OR&hellip;</strong></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The delivery of the letter coincided with an event outside Senator Wyden’s office in Portland, OR, where Fight for the Future and a coalition of advocacy groups delivered more than 13,686 signatures to the Senator also asking him to oppose any form of Fast Track authority.  During the action they urged him to oppose the renewal of 1970s-era trade legislation, which they say threatens Oregon high-tech jobs, digital privacy and freedom on the Internet. The signatures will be adhered to hundreds of floppy disks with the message “Fast Track is obsolete technology.” <br/><br/><a href="http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/oregon/2014/03/20/floppy-disk-petition-urges-senator-wyden-oppose-outdated-trade-policy/" target="_blank"><strong>Click here to see photos and a press release about the &ldquo;Floppy Disk&rdquo; petition delivery.</strong></a></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>The letter was coordinated with the assistance of the public interest organizations Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fight for the Future. </span><span>Contact information for those organizations is provided above.</span></p>
<p class="c6 c0"><span>###</span></p>
<p class="c0"><strong><span class="c4">Full text of the letter and list of signers:</span></strong></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dear Senator Ron Wyden,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Congratulations on your recent appointment as Chair of the Senate Finance Committee. As technology companies with business models inextricably linked to the Internet, we admire your work as a staunch defender of users and online rights—most prominently when you led the fight against SOPA and PIPA in Congress.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Today we write about another emerging front in the battle to defend the free Internet—massive trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. These highly secretive, supranational agreements are reported to include provisions that vastly expand on any reasonable definition of &ldquo;trade,” including provisions that impact patents, copyright, and privacy in ways that constrain legitimate online activity and innovation. We applaud your prior efforts as Senator to bring transparency and public participation to trade negotiations. We strongly urge you to uphold and expand this dedication into your new role.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>None of the usual justifications for trade negotiation exclusivity apply to recent agreements like the TPP. Even assuming that it is legitimate to shield the discussions of certain trade barriers—like import tariffs—from political interference, the provisions in these new trade agreements go far beyond such traditional trade issues.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Based on what we’ve seen in leaked copies of the proposed text, we are particularly concerned about the U.S. Trade Representative&rsquo;s proposals around copyright enforcement. Dozens of digital rights organizations and tens of thousands of individuals have raised alarm over provisions that would bind treaty signatories to inflexible digital regulations that undermine free speech. Based on the fate of recent similar measures, it is virtually certain that such proposals would face serious scrutiny if proposed at the domestic level or via a more transparent process. Anticipated elements such as harsher criminal penalties for minor, non-commercial copyright infringements, a &lsquo;take-down and ask questions later&rsquo; approach to pages and content alleged to breach copyright, and the possibility of Internet providers having to disclose personal information to authorities without safeguards for privacy will chill innovation and significantly restrict users&rsquo; freedoms online.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Some aspects of U.S. copyright law, such as the DMCA&rsquo;s safe harbor provisions, have helped foster the vibrant tech industry in this country. But in other areas, we are due for major reforms—a fact made clear by Register of Copyrights Maria Pallante&rsquo;s call for the &quot;Next Great Copyright Act&rdquo; and the House Judiciary Committee&rsquo;s efforts to implement that reform. In light of these needed revisions, the U.S. system cannot be crystallized as the international norm and should not be imposed on other nations. It is crucial that we maintain the flexibility to re-evaluate and reform our legal framework in response to new technological realities. Ceding national sovereignty over critical issues like copyright is not in the best interest of any of the potential signatories of this treaty.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We can only build a successful innovation policy framework—one that supports new ideas, products, and markets—if the process to design it is open and participatory. Unfortunately, the trade negotiation process has been anything but transparent. Our industry, and the users that we serve, need to be at the table from the beginning to design policies that serve more than the narrow commercial interests of the few large corporations who have been invited to participate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We urge you not to pass any version of Fast Track or trade promotion authority, or approve any mechanism that would facilitate the passage of trade agreements containing digital copyright enforcement provisions designed in an opaque, closed-door process.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As the new Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, you are in a position to shape U.S. policy to keep this country a place where innovation thrives. We look forward to your continued dedication to the interests of technology and its users.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Thank you for your attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
