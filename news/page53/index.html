<h3>Net Neutrality activists interrupt FCC meeting, unfurl “Reclassify Now!” banner behind commissioners</h3>
<p><span>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash; This morning at 10:40am, net neutrality demonstrators interrupted the FCC’s monthly meeting by unfurling a large banner reading “Reclassify Now!” behind the seated FCC commissioners. The activists, both union members, were escorted from the room by security after speaking out and asking FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler why he continues to delay Title II net neutrality, which should have been voted on at today’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><strong>See photos of the action here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cS43z" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/cS43z</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>See a video of the action here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zr0L8aKZDxc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/embed/zr0L8aKZDxc </a><br/></strong></p>
<p><span>Other activists inside the meeting held paper signs calling for reclassification of the Internet under Title without delay. Several stood up and spoke to Chairman Wheeler from the floor to ask why net neutrality was left off the agenda before being escorted from the room. Outside, a crowd of protesters gathered with signs reading “Save the Internet! and “Reclassify Under Title II!”</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Activist Vanessa Beck of PopularResistance.org, who participated in the action, said “Nearly 4 million people submitted comments to the FCC on net neutrality, a record number, and more than 99% supported reclassification under Title II. If the FCC was a truly democratic agency, we would have a Title II rule today. Chairman Wheeler needs to stop stalling and listen to the public.”</span></p>
<p><span>While demonstrators made their voices heard at the FCC, digital rights group Fight for the Future, who helped publicize the protests, also rallied support online launching a new feature on </span><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>CallTheFCC.com</span></a><span> that allows supporters to easily email FCC employees with a few clicks. The group has has helped drive more than </span><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/104245377138/press-release-net-neutrality-activists-give-the" target="_blank"><span>40,000 phone calls</span></a><span> to the FCC in recent months.</span></p>
<p><span>The disruption today was organized by PopularResistance.org, the activist group that helped lead </span><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>Occupy the FCC</span></a><span> and famously blockaded FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s driveway last month. Net neutrality supporters vowed to continue escalating their efforts until the FCC votes to approve Title II reclassification and protect the Internet from cable company abuse and censorship.</span><br/><br/><span>###</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:40 EST on December 10, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ngdysaFg2S1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019146038"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-486cc281-3622-0bbc-6c8a-dd6c31ad5250"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank">Illinois just passed a vague law that discourages people from recording their interactions with police by making it a felony to record cops and other government officials in certain circumstances.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The right to record our interactions with law enforcement and government officials is a basic freedom. It protects all of us from abuse. But the legislature of Illinois just hastily passed an amendment attached to a totally unrelated bill that will actually </span><span>increase</span><span> “penalties that people face if they record police or other officials in situations where they have a “reasonable expectation of privacy.” [1]</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is that the bill’s language is so vague that it will leave Illinois residents wondering whether and when they have the right to record their interactions with police. [2] This will have a chilling effect, and if it becomes a trend it and poses a threat to our First Amendment rights. Worse, this bill grants new authorities to police and informants to secretly record conversations without a warrant, [3]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank">Sign the petition to the Governor of Illinois: veto the bill that makes it more illegal to record the cops than for them to record you.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>People from across the political spectrum all agree on one thing: we want more transparency and accountability from our government. Anytime a state passes a law that limits our freedom, it’s important that we push back to prevent it from becoming a dangerous trend.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank">Please click here to sign the petition,</a></strong><span> and then forward this email to as many people as you can.</span></p>
<p><span>More than 10,000 people have taken action on this in just the first few hours of us learning about the bill. If everyone signs and shares this we’ll almost certainly strike a major victory for free speech and privacy.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>-Evan, Tiffiniy, and Holmes</span><span><br/></span><span>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. There’s some confusing information going around about this bill. For example, read </span><strong><a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/crime/eavesdroppinglaw.asp" target="_blank">this</a></strong><span>, and </span><strong><a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/12/no-illinois-didnt-ban-recordings-of-cops-but-they-did-get-more-power-to-eavesdrop-on-you/" target="_blank">this</a></strong><span><strong>.</strong> Our position is that this bill is a net negative for freedom because it imposes stronger penalties when people record police than when they record a civilian, causing a chilling effect, and it gives police and informants new power to record civilians without a warrant. </span><strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/illinois-just-made-it-felony-film-cops/" target="_blank">Read more here.</a></strong><span> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank"><span><strong>The FCC is stalling. They’re meeting on Thursday and somehow net neutrality is not on the agenda. Join us December 11th for a morning of protest at the FCC.</strong> </span><span><br/></span></a><span><br/>Hi Friend,<br/><br/></span><span>FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has delayed a vote on Net Neutrality until 2015 — and he’s probably hoping the public scrutiny will fade by then.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Guess what: It won&rsquo;t. And to make sure he knows it, we&rsquo;re showing up in person at the agency&rsquo;s final meeting of the year to remind Wheeler that we&rsquo;re #StillWatching him and will keep making noise until the FCC protects the open Internet.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank">We need you there next Thursday:</a></strong><span> All you need to do is grab some props (like oversized specs or a magnifying glass) and show up to join in the fun.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the details:</span></p>
<p><strong>What:</strong><span> Rally to Save the Internet: Net Neutrality Now</span></p>
<p><strong>When:</strong><span> Thurs., Dec. 11, 9–10 a.m.</span></p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><span> Outside FCC headquarters, 445 12th St. SW, Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><strong>RSVP: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank"><span>Click here to tell us you&rsquo;re coming and invite your friends.</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Bring:</strong><span> A magnifying glass/specs and a sign calling for Title II, your cell phone, tablet, or laptop with </span><a href="http://protestsign.org" target="_blank"><span>ProtestSign.org</span></a><span> loaded!</span></p>
<p><span>At 10am toward the end of the rally, meet at the back of the protest on the sidewalk on 12th street with other net neutrality supporters who will be going inside the meeting and holding their phones silently in protest. Follow </span><a href="http://twitter.com/fightfortheftr" target="_blank"><strong>@fightfortheftr</strong></a><span> on the day of for updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Wheeler claims he needs more time to mull over Net Neutrality— but you and I both know that he has all the info he needs right now to reclassify Internet-access service under Title II. And there should be no doubt in his mind that reclassifying under Title II is the </span><span>only</span><span> way to protect the open Internet.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank">Join us on Dec. 11 to demand Net Neutrality now—</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Please RSVP if you can make it, and if not, please invite any friends you have in the area!</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all you do,<br/>-Evan at FFTF</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:48 EST on December 3, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ng0iu0e5091ri3xd7.png?1506019146038"/></span></a></p>
<p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>December 3, 2014<br/><br/>Media Contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</span><span><br/><br/><strong>Net neutrality activists give FCC a holiday break, for one week they will stop driving thousands of phone calls</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Fight for the Future and other groups have driven more than 55,000 phone calls to desks at the FCC in the last two months, keeping phones at the agency ringing off the hook with voices for Title II</em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON &ndash; Today, net neutrality activists announced that, in the spirit of the holidays, they will be giving the FCC a one-week break from constant phone calls in support of Title II net neutrality. Internet freedom groups have bombarded 30 top officials at the agency with tens of thousands of phone calls since late September, when it appeared that FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler was preparing to ignore nearly 4 million public comments on the issue.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>To date, the page </span><strong><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank">CallTheFCC.com</a></strong><span> has connected more than 55,000 phone calls to FCC staffers–nearly 1,000 every day for the last two months. More than 1,800 people have signed up to be “daily callers,” meaning they receive a reminder to call a new FCC official each day. Calls skip the FCC switchboard and go directly to the desks of 30 top officials.. FCC officials have told activists via email that their phones are ringing off the hook every hour of the business day.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>This morning, Fight for the Future emailed the 30 FCC employees who have been receiving calls to inform them that they’d be stopping the calls for one week, but that they should expect even more pressure after the FCC meets December 11th – if the FCC does not show clear signs it is moving quickly toward a vote on Title II net neutrality rules in January.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The statement below can be attributed to Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng:</strong><br/></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>The FCC should be accountable to the public, not the special interests of a select few companies. We know that monopolies like Comcast and Verizon spend tens of millions of dollars lobbying and are constantly calling and visiting the FCC to make sure that their position is heard. We built CallTheFCC.com to make sure that the public has the same opportunity.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>In the last few months, we’ve surrounded the FCC with protests and bombarded them with phone calls. </span><strong>Today, in the holiday spirit, we’ll be stopping the phone calls for one week</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We are giving the FCC the benefit of the doubt that they are finally listening to the overwhelming public consensus, and are moving toward a vote on strong Title II net neutrality rules in January. December 11th is FCC’s next meeting, and we will be there in force. If we don’t hear Chairman Wheeler make a strong statement indicating that his agency is listening to the public and moving toward Title II rules, we’ll redouble our calling efforts starting on December 12th, and unveil a new tool that makes it even easier for the public to make their voices heard at the FFC.<br/></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>CallTheFCC.com was built by Fight for the Future, and has been supported by Demand Progress, reddit, Free Press, MoveOn, CREDO Action, Democracy for America, and other netroots organizations.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future were lead organizers of the </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic" target="_blank"><span>Internet Slowdown</span></a><span> on September 10th, which mobilized 40,000 websites in support of Title II net neutrality, and drove more than 750,000 FCC comments and 300,000 phone calls in a single day. They were also instrumental in organizing the </span><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>Occupy the FCC</span></a><span> encampment, which helped bring Title II into the national spotlight, and put it on the table as an option at the FCC.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>“There are so many people who want to speak out on net neutrality, that it’s amazing what happens when you give them an easy way to do it,” </span><strong>said Fight for the Future’s Chief Technical Officer Jeff Lyon,</strong><span><strong> who built CallTheFCC.com,</strong> “We know the people at the FCC are people too, so we’re happy to give them a week off. Hundreds of calls a day is a lot to handle. But they need to do the right thing and stop delaying the process in ways that benefit Cable companies and hurts the public. If the FCC </span><span>does</span><span> move forward with a strong net neutrality rule, we can direct all this attention to defending the FCC’s decision in Congress. There are millions of people ready to fight for net neutrality, the FCC’s choice is whether to side with those millions or go it alone.”</span><span><br/></span></p>

<p><span>The U.S. Trade Representative has confirmed that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is moving again, with  confidential meetings in Washington, DC next week. TPP-defenders in Congress have already been making noise about a Fast Track vote, and this could be a sign that it’s coming soon. </span></p>
<p><span>Just last month, the latest version of the TPP’s crucial copyright &amp; intellectual property chapter was leaked, and the news was not good. </span><span>The Internet censorship provisions in the </span><span>TPP have gotten even worse. </span><span>[1]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">Don’t let governments censor the net. Take action now to stop Fast Track for the TPP.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’ve beaten the TPP back before. It’s time to do it again. While these secret meetings are being pushed by the White House, corrupt officials in Congress want to “fast track” the TPP right now during the lame duck session. [2] The vote could be close. Will you take action now to stop Internet censorship?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.stopfasttrack.com/" target="_blank">Click here to stop the TPP Internet censorship plan.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Millions of people have already spoken out against the TPP power grab. Every issue we care about depends on the future of the free and open web. Take a moment today to defend it.</span></p>
