<p id="docs-internal-guid-7f092a6f-fa09-1532-427a-272e31743bf9"><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</span><span><br/></span><span>January 17, 2015</span></p>
<p><span>Media contact: Evan Greer<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457</span><span><br/></span><span>Email: </span><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span>press@fightforthefuture.org</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Internet freedom activists unfurl banner in front of Senator Ron Wyden at town hall event: “Don’t Betray the Internet! No Fast Track for the TPP!”</strong></p>
<p><span>Grants Pass, OR&ndash; Today, activists working in coordination with digital rights group Fight for the Future briefly disrupted a town hall meeting hosted by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden when they unfurled a banner behind the Senator reading, </span><span>“Senator Wyden: Don’t Betray the Internet! No Fast Track for the TPP!”</span></p>
<p><strong>Click here to see photos of the action: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/FOMuS" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/FOMuS</a></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The activists are joining tens of thousands of voices who have called upon Senator Wyden to oppose outdated and undemocratic “Fast Track” legislation, also known as “Trade Promotion Authority,” as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive, secretive trade deal that has been condemned by advocacy organizations from across the political spectrum.</span></p>
<p><span>“Senator Wyden has long been considered a champion of Internet freedom, which is why it’s unthinkable that he’s pushing for outdated Fast Track legislation, which could have dire consequences for the future of the free and open web,” s</span><span>aid Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future.</span><span> “Senator Wyden now has a choice: he can be remembered as the hero who stuck to his principles and defended the Internet, or as the traitor who allowed DC politics and corporate interests to poison the web with censorship.”</span></p>
<p><span>While activists on the ground in Oregon brought their message directly to Senator Wyden, thousands more </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ronwyden" target="_blank"><span>took action online</span></a><span>, tweeting, calling, and emailing the Senator to ask him to oppose Fast Track legislation and stand up for the free and open Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Previously, Fight for the Future, Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, and other groups sent Senator Wyden </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wyden/" target="_blank"><span>thousands of floppy discs </span></a><span>as part of a campaign calling for him to oppose Fast Track legislation. The Senator also </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/letter/" target="_blank"><span>received an open letter</span></a><span> signed by more than 25 tech companies, asking him to oppose such legislation.</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:08 EST on January 14, 2015</span>


        <div>
<p><span><strong><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ni6qo8QAHQ1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019145722"/></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>A Ringing Endorsement for For Net Neutrality: Reddit, Activism Orgs To Drive Thousands of Phone Calls To Congress</span></strong></span></p>
<p><em>Effort marks one-year anniversary of court decision undermining Net Neutrality rules</em></p>
<p><span>Washington D.C. (<span><span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_121786234"><span class="aQJ">January 14, 2015</span></span></span></span>) – Members of Congress should expect to hear from tens of thousands of constituents in the coming days as Internet users rise up once again in support of strong Net Neutrality rules. The calls are being organized by Demand Progress, Fight For The Future, Free Press Action Fund, and reddit. The effort is hosted at <a href="http://nathanwhite.cmail2.com/t/t-l-trdykdd-zudkljrl-z/" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a>, a hub site for Net Neutrality activists, and marks the anniversary of a court decision striking down net neutrality rules that were promulgated under an inappropriate authority.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC is expected to issue a new Net Neutrality rule on <span><span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_121786235"><span class="aQJ">February 26th</span></span></span></span>. Constituent input to Congress is critical, as Congress may or may not attempt to overturn the FCC’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span>By visiting <a href="http://nathanwhite.cmail2.com/t/t-l-trdykdd-zudkljrl-v/" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a> and entering just their phone number and zip code, users will receive an automated call connecting them to both their senators and their representative.</span></p>
<p><span>Reddit, which receives more than 170 million unique visitors each month, will use space on its front page to promote the effort.</span></p>
<p><span>Calls will be placed to Congress all day long, but those who call Congress after <span><span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_121786236"><span class="aQJ">3pm</span></span></span></span> Eastern will then be connected to reddit co-founder and executive chair Alexis Ohanian. Mr. Ohanian will be broadcast live on reddit so that users can watch as he frenetically thanks as many Internet users as possible for standing up for Net Neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span>“The Internet is driving the new digital economy, but legacy corporations would like to stifle that innovation. </span><span>Steve Huffman &amp; I were very fortunate in starting reddit, so I&rsquo;m honored to spend a day thanking the Internet users who are fighting to save Net Neutrality for the next generation of tech entrepreneurs</span><span>,” said Alexis Ohanian.</span></p>
<p><span>“Too often in Washington, well-heeled lobbyists get their way simply because the rules are too arcane for the average person to follow. That simply isn&rsquo;t the case with the Internet. The future of the Internet is too important to sell off to the highest bidder,” said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress.</span></p>
<p><span>“Brace yourself, Congress. The Internet is coming,” said Evan Greer, campaign director at Fight For The Future.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for members of Congress to either get on the right side of the Net Neutrality issue or get out of the way,&rdquo; said Free Press Action Fund President and CEO Craig Aaron. &ldquo;Millions of Americans have spoken out, and the FCC is poised to give us the real Net Neutrality rules we need. Congress has already put in place the bipartisan legal framework that would make this a reality. The FCC now just needs to act by reclassifying Internet access under Title II.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Net Neutrality is the fundamental principle of the Internet that treats all web traffic equally. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) must treat the small amount of traffic necessary to check an email the same as traffic necessary to stream video. If Net Neutrality didn&rsquo;t exist, ISPs would be free to change the speed at which you can access certain content to extract profit, or block it all together.</span></p>
<p><span>Verizon sued the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), arguing that the FCC’s 2010 rules were promulgated under an faulty authority. A court agreed exactly one year ago today.</span></p>
<p><span>While corporations like Verizon and Comcast see extra profits to be had by selling priority access to their consumers, Internet users have demanded that the FCC simply reclassify broadband Internet and keep similar rules to those that have always governed the Internet. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will announce his plans on <span><span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_121786237"><span class="aQJ">February 5th</span></span></span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Millions of people have called or written the FCC demanding the agency reclassify broadband Internet access under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. A previous effort organized by The Battle for The Net coalition generated more than 300,000 phone calls, 800,000 FCC comments and 2,000,000 emails to Congress in a single day in support of Net Neutrality.</span></p>

        <p><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ni6jzmb0v51ri3xd7.png?1506019145722"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-12bec1b7-e923-0f2a-9aa8-2b1b6cfa319a"><span>So today we did something a little absurd. </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank">We launched 535 websites. One for each member of Congress. </a></strong></p>
<p><span>Why? The battle over net neutrality in the U.S. is coming to a final showdown, and the outcome will affect every Internet user in the world. One year ago today, Verizon’s lawyers got our net neutrality protections struck down in court. [1] </span></p>
<p><span>Since then,</span><span> we’ve unleashed an Internet-sized can of whoop-ass</span><span> on the FCC, the White House, fence-sitting tech giants, Team Cable lobbyists, and anyone else standing in the way of keeping the Internet open and unfettered by corporate and government interference.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank">Click here to tell Congress to stand with the Internet or get out of the way!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The online free speech movement has gained so much ground that Comcast and Verizon are now begging the FCC to implement the rules that just a year ago today </span><span>they sued to strike down.</span><span> [2]</span></p>
<p><span>We’re winning. We we&rsquo;re winning so hard. </span><strong>There’s literally only one thing that can stop us now: partisan nonsense in Congress.</strong></p>
<p><span>I know what you’re thinking: partisan nonsense in Congress can ruin ANYTHING. You’re right. That’s why we’re pulling out the stops on this one. </span><span>We made every member of Congress their very own website showing where they stand on net neutrality. Are they with the public or in bed with corporate monopolies that want to regulate the Internet?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard" target="_blank">Click here to find out if your member of Congress is helping kill net neutrality. Then share.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Congress knows that the public is overwhelmingly in support of net neutrality. We need to let them know that there will be political consequences for any politician who betrays the open Internet. </span><span>These sites are just the first part of the plan, but they’re exactly the kind of attention politicians don’t like.</span><span> It’s like if we put up giant billboards with their faces on them, except it only costs a couple bucks per site :-) </span></p>
<p><span>Congress has been scared of the Internet ever since SOPA. </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank"><span><span>Let’s keep it that way.</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>Yours for the web,<br/>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, Jeff, Kevin, and Vasjen</span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. The FCC decision is coming up at the end of next month and we need to bring on more people so we can kick our campaigns up a notch. </span><a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><span>Please chip in $10 to help if you can!</span></a></p>

<p>For Immediate Release<br/>January 14th, 2015<br/><br/>Media contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Net Neutrality Supporters Launch 535 Websites to Get Congress on the Record </strong></span>  <br/><br/><em>BattlefortheNet.com plans to light up phones on Capitol Hill to show widespread support for real open Internet protections</em></span></p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, Net Neutrality advocates launched 535 websites, one for each member of Congress, to identify where the officials stand on the open Internet and generate calls in favor of protections.<br/><br/> By visiting <strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard" target="_blank">BattlefortheNet.com/scoreboard</a></strong> users can locate their members’ websites and then contact their senators and representatives to urge support for Net Neutrality.<br/><br/> Each website notes whether that member of Congress is on “Team Internet” (a Net Neutrality supporter), “Team Cable” (a Net Neutrality opponent), or “unknown” (yet to make a statement for or against open Internet rules). <br/><br/> Demand Progress, Fight for the Future and the Free Press Action Fund launched this effort on the anniversary of the federal appeals court decision that struck down the FCC’s Open Internet Order and left Internet users without any protections against online discrimination and blocking.<br/><br/> After a year of public comments, advocacy and activism, the FCC is expected to issue a new Net Neutrality rule that will reclassify broadband Internet access as a Title II service under the Communications Act.<br/><br/> Protecting the rights of Internet users has become a leading political issue in recent years. As a new Congress gets to work in 2015, several members have proposed legislation to address Net Neutrality, but Congress already wrote the law that would protect Internet users.  <br/><br/> The FCC appears ready to restore for broadband the basic consumer protections Congress originally enacted for all two-way communications services. According to organizers of BattlefortheNet.com, members of Congress should not interfere with or delay the process unless they are willing to support the FCC’s efforts to preserve these fundamental protections.<br/><br/> “It’s time for members of Congress to either get on the right side of the Net Neutrality issue or get out of the way,” said Free Press Action Fund President and CEO <strong>Craig Aaron</strong>. “Millions of Americans have spoken out and the FCC is poised to give us the real Net Neutrality rules we need. Congress has already put in place the bipartisan legal framework that would make this a reality. The FCC now just needs to act by reclassifying Internet access under Title II.”</p>
<p>“Too often in Washington, well-heeled lobbyists get their way simply because the rules are too arcane for the average person, or even a member of Congress, to follow. Getting Internet policy right is too important to everyone. We can’t let the Internet’s future be decided by the highest bidder,” said Demand Progress Executive Director <strong>David Segal</strong>.</p>
<p>“Members of Congress should expect to hear from tens of thousands of constituents in the coming days as Internet users rise up once again in support of strong Net Neutrality rules,” said Fight for the Future Campaign Director <strong>Evan Greer</strong>. “Brace yourself, Congress. The Internet is coming.”</p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-277e8f05-c138-d3be-d91e-10324850ff63"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>You’re going to like this. </span><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">We just built a new tool in the fight for net neutrality. Check it out!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Have you ever had a super frustrating situation with your Cable company &ndash; over your bill, their crappy service, slow connection, or whatever&ndash;and gotten upset with the customer service representative on the phone?</span></p>
<p><span>Hey, we’ve all been there. But the reality is those underpaid call center employees aren’t the ones to blame for your Cable bill catastrophe or that slow loading pinwheel on the video you want to stream.</span></p>
<p><span>Comcast’s top executives and lobbyists are laughing all the way to the bank while they make your Internet slow and keep your Cable bill sky high. Worse, they’re spreading blatant lies about net neutrality and throwing around millions of dollars in campaign contributions to buy off Congress and protect their monopoly power.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">These are the people who are to blame. And we found their phone numbers and email addresses. Click here to put all your frustration to good use and tell Comcast to stop lying.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Comcast has millions to spend on lobbying and and they can blanket Washington, DC in misleading ads. The public has a right to call and demand that they stop their campaign of deceit &ndash; and every minute that Comcast’s lobbyists spend on the phone with you is a minute they’re not spending trying to kill net neutrality.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">Think about it. Now click here to call a Comcast lobbyist!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Thanks team! More soon.<br/>-Jeff at Fight for the Future</span><br/><br/><span>P.S. Comcast’s buddies in Congress are trying to pass a shady law called “Title X.” </span><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/stop-titlex" target="_blank">Click here to sign our urgent petition to stop them.</a></strong></p>
