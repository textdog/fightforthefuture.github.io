        <span class="date">Posted 07:41 EST on November 10, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://www.popularresistance.org/breaking-net-neutrality-activists-blockade-fcc-chairman-tom-wheelers-house/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_netps94eIz1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019146283"/></a></p>
<p>Whoah! We just heard about this. Activists from PopularResistance.org organized one of the first ever acts of civil disobedience for net neutrality this morning when they blockaded corrupt FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler&rsquo;s driveway just as he was getting into his car.</p>
<p>Check out Popular Resistance&rsquo;s press release below, and follow them <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/popresistance" target="_blank">@PopResistance</a></strong> on twitter for breaking action updates.<br/>Original link: <a href="https://www.popularresistance.org/breaking-net-neutrality-activists-blockade-fcc-chairman-tom-wheelers-house/" target="_blank">https://www.popularresistance.org/breaking-net-neutrality-activists-blockade-fcc-chairman-tom-wheelers-house/</a></p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>Media Contact:<br/> Email: info@popularresistance.org<br/> Kevin Zeese 301-996-6520<br/> Margaret Flowers 410-591-0892</p>
<p>Net Neutrality Advocates Blockade FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s Georgetown Home<br/> Demand Full Reclassification under Title II, No Hybrid Plan</p>
<p>Advocates for net neutrality who oppose the tiered Internet proposed by FCC Chairman, Tom Wheeler, blockaded his driveway this morning, Monday, November 10, 2014, just as the Chairman was getting into his car. Six people participated in the blockade with a large banner that read “Save the Internet.” They also held signs demanding that Wheeler listen to the people. They chanted “Hey Hey, Ho Ho, Tom Wheeler has got to go” and sang “Which side are you on Tom? Are you with the people or with the Telecoms?”</p>
<p>The protest, which kicked off at 6:55am, is organized by PopularResistance.org, the same group that Occupied the FCC from May 7 to May 15. They are demanding that Wheeler drop plans to advance so-called “hybrid” rules that fail to protect free speech, and fully reclassify the Internet as a common carrier under Title II.</p>
<p>“We’re blockading Tom Wheeler’s driveway because he’s made it clear that when he goes to work, he’s not working for the public, he’s working for Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T, the companies that used to pay his salary when he was a lobbyist for the Cable industry,” said Kevin Zeese, co-director of Popular Resistance, “The future of the Internet is a life or death matter for marginalized people all over the world. We cannot in good conscience allow this corrupt official to carry on with business as usual.”</p>
<p>“The Internet is an essential tool in all of our lives for many reasons such as the growing citizen’s media, information sharing and access to goods and services. All people must have equal access to content without discrimination. Wealthy corporations should not get faster Internet delivery service than start-ups and citizens’ groups. ” said Margaret Flowers, MD, co-director of Popular Resistance.</p>
<p>Zeese added “The FCC received a record number of comments, with more than 3.7 million responding to the rulemaking proceeding on the future of the Internet; 99% of those comments favored net neutrality and reclassification. How dare Chairman Wheeler ignore the overwhelming majority of the people in favor of corporations like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T. Tom Wheeler is playing with fire. We will be escalating our protests if he continues down the path of ignoring the people. If Wheeler is unable to fulfill President Obama’s promise to protect net neutrality, then he should resign or be removed from office.”</p>
<p>Wheeler served as the top lobbyist for Internet corporations before becoming chair of the FCC. “This is a crisis of democracy. The people have clearly spoken and Wheeler is supposed to represent the public interest, not the interests of Comcast and Verizon. It is time for him to listen to the public and reclassify the Internet as a common carrier so it can be regulated like a public utility,” added Flowers.</p>
<p>Popular Resistance is urging people to join them at a Vigil to Save the Internet tonight, November 10th, at Tom Wheeler’s Georgetown home. Journalists or activists interested in attending should contact Margaret Flowers or Kevin Zeese at the numbers above. Following successful nationwide protests last week, the group is also working with other net neutrality advocates to hold a Dance Party to Save the Internet at the White House on Thursday evening, November 13th, at 6 PM in Lafayette Park.</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 08:18 EST on November 7, 2014</span>


        <p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>November 7, 2014</span></p>
<p><strong>Media Contact:<br/></strong><span>Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>Email: </span><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span>press@fightforthefuture.org</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Net neutrality protests sweep the U.S. after FCC leaks “hybrid” proposal that fails to protect free speech</strong></p>
<p><span>Hundreds of Internet users - holding their lit up cell phones and laptops aloft in protest - joined more than 30 demonstrations across the U.S. on Thursday night. They took to the streets in an outpouring of anger over reports that the Federal Communications Committee is planning to push a “hybrid” net neutrality proposal that opens the door for cable company censorship and abuse.</span></p>
<p><span>More than 100 people gathered in front of the White House in Washington, DC with light-up signs reading “SAVE THE INTERNET,” chanting “Hey hey! Ho ho! Tom Wheeler has got to go.” Crowds turned out in dozens of other cities as well including Boston, MA; San Francisco, CA; Philadelphia, PA; Anchorage, AK; Chicago, IL; and New York, NY.</span></p>
<p><strong>See photos from the protests here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WD42O" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/WD42O</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>See a short video from the White House protest here: <a href="http://youtu.be/gpaU7OnJDxE" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/gpaU7OnJDxE</a></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>“Internet users are outraged that President Obama and his FCC appointee are choosing to ignore the voices of millions of people who have called for strong net neutrality rules that protect free speech and are instead pushing a sham proposal that fails to protect our rights,” </span><strong>said Evan Greer, Campaign Director of Fight for the Future,</strong><span> “These protests are just the beginning. I’ve never seen people turn out like this on such short notice. The President and the FCC should take warning: hell hath no fury like the Internet scorned.”</span></p>
<p><span>The #InternetEmergency rapid-response protests were organized with just a few days notice by </span><strong>Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, Free Press, and PopularResistance.org</strong><span>, advocacy groups that played a pivotal role in the massive Internet Slowdown online protest last month that mobilized more than 40,000 websites and sent more than 700,000 comments to the FCC and 300,000 phone calls to Congress in support of Title II reclassification.</span></p>
<p><span>The protests were inspired in part by massive demonstrations that swept Hungary after the government their proposed an Internet Tax, where protesters held up their cell phones as a sign of protest. For the #InternetEmergency protests, Fight for the Future took the tactic a step further by creating </span><a href="http://protestsign.org" target="_blank"><span>ProtestSign.org</span></a><span>, a website that allows anyone to turn their phone, laptop, or tablet into a net neutrality protest sign.</span></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-11-06-guide-to-anchoring-an-internetemergency-protest/">Guide to anchoring an #InternetEmergency Protest</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 15:11 EST on November 6, 2014</span>


        <p><span><strong>Dozens of Fight for the Future members, people just like you, are hosting #InternetEmergency protests tonight across the U.S. Here&rsquo;s a quick guide for how to do it right!<br/></strong><br/>Hi everyone–</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks so much for being a host! Here’s some quick and simple tips &amp; instructions for tonight’s protest!</span></p>
<p><span>First, the easy stuff:</span></p>
<p><span>- be ready to say something to welcome folks.</span></p>
<p><span>- the east coast is rainy right now. bring umbrellas :)</span></p>
<p><span>- the hashtag for the event is #InternetEmergency</span></p>
<p><span>- make sure you are prepared to take photos and send them to us (reply all to this message with photos or e-mail team@fightforthefuture.org)</span></p>
<p><span>- read the crowd and decide how long you want to stay. 1 hour would be great!</span></p>
<p><span>- if there’s something obvious to do after, invite people. make it social.</span></p>
<p><span>On photos (because it’s really, really important):</span></p>
<p><span>1)</span><span> Make sure you have a smartphone </span><span>with a good camera ready for taking pictures. Since it’s important for us to get photos out to media in a rapid way, the phone is the most important thing. It’s also wonderful to have high quality photos taken on a point-and-shoot or an SLR. If you don’t have a smartphone (which is heroic, btw) invite a friend who has one!</span></p>
<p><span>2) Get as many people as possible to load protestsign.org on their phones, tablets, and laptops. Post this URL to the Facebook group too, so people with laptops can load it beforehand! You can swipe up/down for different colors, and left/right for different text.</span></p>
<p><span>3) Take a few group photos of everyone. Think about the best way to show the group, while including something iconic in the background (a logo, a sign, a landmark capitol building, etc). Don’t be far away. Fill the frame with people and faces, trying to capture the spirit and diversity of your group. Try to capture the “Save the Internet” or “#EmergencyProtest” text on phones or laptops in the photo. </span><span>Then email your group photos to team@fightforthefuture.org so we can pick the best ones and circulate to press.</span></p>
<p><span>4) Once you get a group photo, get people to do individual pictures holding their phone with protestsign.org loaded. They can hold the phone at the camera, or hold it above their head, whatever works well for you. You can post photos to #InternetEmergency but </span><span>also ask people to email their photos to team@fightforthefuture.org.</span></p>
<p><span>The main thing: make sure you and individuals post and email the photos to us right after they take them, so we can quickly circulate to press.</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond that, I’ve included some talking points below, and some articles that are helpful for talking about where the FCC is at.</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll be hosting a protest in my hometown of Worcester, MA tonight as well. So I’ll be following these instructions myself! Can’t wait to see  all of this come together :)</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p><span>–Holmes Wilson &amp; the whole Fight for the Future team.</span></p>
<p><span>TALKING POINTS:</span></p>
<p><span>* We&rsquo;re just outraged by last week&rsquo;s WSJ leak. Nearly 4 million Americans and thousands of tech companies have come forward against paid prioritization and what does Tom Wheeler come up with? Paid Prioritization.</span></p>
<p><span>* In the history of the FCC there hasn&rsquo;t been a single issue that got this much public outcry– and the FCC does the exact opposite of what the public&rsquo;s asking for.</span></p>
<p><span>*But now the tides are turning, and we&rsquo;re winning huge victories in Congress and the White House on net neutrality - it&rsquo;s time for the FCC to make the right decision and enact real net neutrality.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>*Tom Wheeler, the FCC chairman, is now stalling against enacting strong open Internet rules. No more delays, no more compromises, we need real net neutrality now!<br/></span></p>

<p><strong>Net neutrality activists organize protests at White House and nationwide, opposing FCC’s leaked “hybrid” proposal, demanding real net neutrality</strong></p>

<p><span>On Thursday, November 6th, net neutrality activists will protest in front of the White House in Washington, DC and in at least a dozen other cities across the country to demand that the FCC and the White House drop their proposal for “hybrid” net neutrality rules that fail to protect Internet users from censorship and discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span>Inspired by successful mass protests against an unpopular Internet Tax in Hungary, demonstrators will hold their cell phones, laptops, and tablets above their heads as a symbol of protest, and shine light on the corruption unfolding in Washington, DC.</span></p>

<p><strong>WHAT:</strong><span> </span><span>Nationwide Emergency Protests for net neutrality</span></p>
<p><strong>WHEN: </strong><span>November 6, 2014, 6PM EST, CST, MT and PST, depending on locality.</span></p>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong><span> The White House, Lafayette Park, Washington, DC; </span><span><br/><br/></span><strong>And more than 30 other cities including:</strong></p>
<p><span>MA State House, Boston, MA;<br/>Comcast HQ, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;<br/>Minnesota State Capitol, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota;<br/>Civic Center Plaza, San Francisco, CA;<br/>Federal Building, Cincinnati, OH;<br/>Federal Plaza, Chicago, IL<br/>City Hall, Houston, TX<br/>Federal Court House, Las Vegas, NV</span><span></span><span><br/></span><span>Capitol Building, Austin, TX</span><span></span><span><br/></span><span>At&amp;T Building, Worcester, MA<br/>Park Square, Asheville, NC</span></p>
<p><span><strong>WHY:</strong> </span><span>To demand that the FCC drop its leaked proposal for corrupt, discriminatory “fastlanes” and listen to the 4 million Americans and thousands of businesses who’ve called for real net neutrality through Title II reclassification. </span></p>
<p><strong>VISUALS: </strong><span>Group of open Internet advocates holding cellphones, laptops, flashlights, candles; White House and other government buildings in other cities. In DC there will be a light up sign reading “SAVE THE INTERNET.”</span></p>
<p><strong>WHO: </strong><span>The protests are supported by Fight for the Future, PopularResistance.org, Free Press, Demand Progress, reddit, and several other grassroots organizations in collaboration with millions of online supporters.</span></p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><span> Nearly 4 million Americans (alongside companies like Reddit, Tumblr, Netflix, and Google) have spoken out against discriminatory fastlanes and for real net neutrality. September’s #InternetSlowdown protest rallied over 40,000 websites and drove 312,000 calls to Congress and more than 700,000 comments to the FCC. But last week, news leaked in the Wall Street Journal that the FCC was planning to do the exact opposite: enshrine paid fastlanes in law, giving cable companies power over the open Internet. The current FCC chairman Tom Wheeler is a former cable &amp; telecom industry lobbyist. Obama, who appointed Wheeler, has promised net neutrality from the campaign trail in 2008 to as recently as weeks ago. But the Obama administration has yet to reign in Wheeler’s plan to hand his former employers legal power over America’s Internet. Internet users are well organized after several mass online actions, and are preparing escalating responses leading up to the FCC’s final decision in the coming weeks.</span></p>
