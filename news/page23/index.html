      <h1><a href="/news/2016-05-19-chelsea-mannings-military-appeal-filed-legal/">Chelsea Manning’s Military Appeal Filed: Legal Defense Team Argues for Commutation of Sentence and Groups File Four Related Amici Briefs</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:34 EDT on May 19, 2016</span>


        <p><strong>Defense Team Mounts Appeal Based on Harsh Treatment and Excessive Sentencing. ACLU, Amnesty International, Open Society Justice Initiative, Electronic Frontier Foundation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, File Amicus Briefs on Critical Components of Chelsea Manning’s Case</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contact:</strong> Christina DiPasquale, <a href="tel://2027161953" target="_blank">202.716.1953</a>, <a href="mailto:christina@balestramedia.com" target="_blank">christina@balestramedia.com</a></p>
<p>
Today, Chelsea Manning’s Legal Defense Team released the text of the unclassified portion of the 250-page appeal filed with the US Army Court of Criminal Appeals yesterday. In the appellate brief, her counsel urges the court to dismiss the case, or at a minimum, reduce the unprecedented thirty-five year confinement term to ten years. The appeal presents several reasons Chelsea’s case should be dismissed or the confinement term reduced, including that she was placed in solitary confinement for almost one year while awaiting trial, the government failed to produce significant evidence that Chelsea’s disclosures actually harmed the United States’ national security or diplomatic interests, the military judge considered improper aggravation evidence at sentencing, and several of the charges lacked evidence or violated constitutional or other legal principles. Finally, the appeal points out that Chelsea’s sentence is the harshest in history for a whistleblower, and should be reduced out of fairness.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Read the appeal brief here: <a href="http://bit.ly/27EkPE0" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/27EkPE0</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
“There is no question that Chelsea Manning’s sentence is incredibly excessive—wildly disproportionate to the reality of the situation and precedent—as it represents the most severe punishment received by any other whistleblower in American history,” said attorney Vincent Ward, co-counsel for the Chelsea Manning Legal Defense team. “Chelsea was struggling with the mental and emotional effects of gender dysphoria at a time when there was little national dialogue about transgender issues, without receiving the support from the US Army to which she was entitled or the whistleblower protections that should be offered. We hope that this court will take her harsh treatment into account and use its jurisdiction to adjust Chelsea’s sentence fairly.”
</p>
<p>
In its amicus brief, Amnesty International Ltd. contends that the military judge erred in concluding that Chelsea Manning “was not held in solitary confinement.” In fact, Manning was held for nine months before trial in a 6’ by 8’ cell for 23 to 24 hours a day. That is prolonged solitary confinement as defined by the Nelson Mandela Rules, which the United States sponsored and the United Nations unanimously adopted. Thus, the conditions of Manning’s pretrial detainment violated United States and international law, as discussed in detail in Amnesty International&rsquo;s amicus brief.
<strong><a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/filed-amnesty_int27l_brief.pdf">More here.</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A war against whistleblowers is being waged in this country and this case represents how this country treats anyone who reveals even a single page of classified information,” added attorney Nancy Hollander, lead counsel for the Chelsea Manning Legal Defense team. “We need brave individuals to hold the government accountable for its actions at home and abroad and we call upon this court to overturn the dangerous precedent of Chelsea Manning’s excessive sentencing.”</p>
<p>
Capt. Dave Hammond at the U.S. Army Defense Appellate Division is co-counsel for Chelsea Manning on this appeal and co-authored the brief.
</p>
<p>
In their amicus brief, the Open Society Justice Initiative argues that the 35-year sentence imposed on Manning far exceeds international legal norms and should be reduced. Drawing on a survey of law and practice in 30 countries, it notes that the sentence is &quot;far higher than the penalties that our closest allies would consider proportionate&rdquo; in this case. In the U.K, for example, the crimes of which Manning was found guilty carry a maximum penalty of 2 years in jail.  Several countries have developed jurisprudence requiring that the aggregate sentence for multiple offenses, especially where related—for  instance, as in Manning’s case, disclosures made to the same person—should not be unduly harsh, and generally should not exceed the maximum penalty for a single offense.
<strong><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/press-releases/chelsea-manning-appeal-brief-35-year-prison-sentence-far-exceeds-norms" target="_blank">More here.</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the Espionage Act, under which there have been few prosecutions considering its vague and unconstitutional provisions, charges were also leveled against Chelsea Manning under the antiquated Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984—a statute usually applied to hackers—and the unproven claim that her disclosures caused any specific harm.
</p>
<p>
The American Civil Liberties Union’s amicus brief, focusing on the First Amendment, argues that Manning’s conviction under the Espionage Act should be overturned because the prosecution was unconstitutional. The Espionage Act is unconstitutionally vague when it is used against government whistleblowers or leakers because it gives the government too much leeway to engage in selective prosecution of disfavored speakers, leaving some leakers alone and sending others to prison, even if they all revealed similarly classified information. The law also violates the First Amendment because it results in prosecutions where a court gives no consideration to the public interest in the disclosures, including whether any of the information reveals government illegality or misconduct.

</p>
<p>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), joined by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, filed a brief asking the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals Wednesday to overturn Chelsea Manning’s conviction for violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), arguing that the law is intended to punish people for breaking into computer systems—something Manning didn’t do. EFF told the court that violating a written policy, which restricted Manning from using unauthorized software to access a State Department database, is not a crime under the CFAA.

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-05-17-a-look-inside-the-closed-door-dmca-meetings/">A look inside the closed-door DMCA meetings</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:49 EDT on May 17, 2016</span>


        <a href="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org/takedownabuse.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org/takedownabuse_cropped.jpg" alt="Jeff and Andrew Lyon outside SF courthouse"/></a>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I’m Jeff, CTO at Fight for the Future.  We recently teamed up with <a href="http://channelawesome.com" target="_blank">Channel Awesome</a> to launch <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">takedownabuse.org</a>, a web protest to fight the ongoing mass censorship of the Internet due to abusive copyright takedowns under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who helped overwhelm the government with nearly 100,000 public comments, we were able to convince the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) to give us a seat at the table in their closed-door meetings on DMCA reforms. Mike from Channel Awesome and I traveled to San Francisco, eager to speak on behalf of everyone who took action at <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">takedownabuse.org</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the hearings appeared to be rigged against the public interest, and unless we step up our game, it’s looking very likely that the USCO will make the DMCA even worse, with major giveaways to the copyright industry that put SOPA-style restrictions on independent content creators.</p>

<p>Here are some of my experiences and thoughts about what we’re up against:</p>

<ul><li><p>The “roundtable discussions” were closed-door meetings with limited seating that effectively shut the public out from the proceedings. No live streaming was available and very limited open microphone time made it nearly impossible for anyone who wasn’t an invited participant to speak.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of participants, the hearings were dominated by representatives and lobbyists from the copyright industry. Representatives from other public interest groups like Mozilla and EFF were completely outnumbered by organizations like the RIAA, MPAA, Digimarc and Copyright Alliance. You can <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/policy/section512/ca-agenda.pdf" target="_blank">see the participant list here</a>, but the end result was the lobbyists were able to skew the discussions in their favor.</p></li>
<li><p>The copyright industry wants to eliminate the counter-notice process that people can use to fight DMCA takedown claims. Instead they want a “take down, stay down” system where website owners have to police user-uploaded content and proactively remove any copyrighted material. I argued that this would create an enormous burden for website owners and make it effectively impossible for users to upload copyrighted works in fair-use contexts (such as parody or political commentary).</p></li>
<li><p>The only time I saw the stone-faced regulators break from their serious demeanor was when it was the MPAA attorney’s turn to talk. After some some light-hearted joking banter with the regulators, the MPAA attorney suggested new legislation to take down entire websites (aka SOPA) for suspected copyright infringement.</p></li>
<li><p>There were repeated attempts by the copyright industry to discredit the nearly 100,000 public comments sent through <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">takedownabuse.org</a>. I sat next to the CEO of Copyright Alliance, who had previously likened us to “<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-group-likens-massive-dmca-abuse-protests-to-zombie-apocalypse-160409/" target="_blank">zombies.</a>” One of the other participants accused us of engaging in a cyber attack. Both Mike from Channel Awesome and I argued passionately on behalf of everyone who submitted comments, that the Copyright Office needs to take the public input seriously. We are not robots or zombies or hackers! We are real people who are living with an Internet where fair use and free speech is under attack.</p></li>
</ul><p>And here’s where the good news starts. The MPAA and RIAA wanted to go into these meetings and have a one-sided discussion where they could spread doom-and-gloom about how the Internet is destroying their business models. We made this impossible. They never expected to be facing down 100,000 public comments and the same people who helped kill SOPA. We called the industry to task for their abuse of the DMCA and we’re ready for anything they might throw at us next.</p>

<p>Speaking of that, the U.S. Copyright Office will open up another round of public commenting in the coming weeks. We don’t yet know whether they’ll take our concerns seriously, but we will have a lot more than 24 hours to get our comments in, regardless. Please stay tuned by signing up at <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">www.takedownabuse.org</a> and we’ll be sure to tell you when the next round of comments opens!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jeff Lyon<br/>
CTO, Fight for the Future</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-04-13-internet-activists-stand-in-solidarity-with/">Internet activists stand in solidarity with striking Verizon workers</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:27 EDT on April 13, 2016</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>April 13, 2016<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>Leading net neutrality advocates Fight for the Future say Verizon’s greed is bad for workers as well as the Internet</i></h2><p>Today, more than 40,000 Verizon workers went on <b><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/276119-verizon-workers-go-on-strike" target="_blank">strike</a>,</b> demanding fair treatment from the telecom giant that grossed more than $4 billion in profit last year. <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><b>Fight for the Future</b></a>, a leading digital rights group best known for organizing some of the largest online protests in history, including the massive online protests against SOPA and in support of net neutrality, issued the following statement in support of Verizon workers, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p><i>“Given everything we know about how terribly Verizon treats their customers and Internet users as a whole, it’s no surprise to us that they fail to show their employees basic respect as well.</i></p><p><i>Last year, they attempted to strike down net neutrality rules that protect the Internet as a platform for freedom of expression and exchange of ideas. The Internet rose up and we defeated them, gaining even stronger protections than the ones they sued to strike down.</i></p><p><i>Rather than treating their customers and employees fairly, Verizon has chosen to rely on political influence and corruption in a never ending quest to increase short term profits regardless of the long term cost to society.</i></p><p><i>We at Fight for the Future stand in solidarity with the striking Verizon workers, and with all Internet users who are fighting to defend the Internet from the attacks of monopolistic ISPs like Verizon.”</i></p><p><i>Verizon’s customers fought for net neutrality, and won. Verizon’s workers deserve to win fair treatment too, and we wish them success in their struggle.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Please note: Greer’s correct pronouns are she/hers.</p><p>Fight for the Future was instrumental in the massive grassroots campaign that successfully pushed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the strongest net neutrality protections in US. history last year. They built the page <b><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a>,</b> which was responsible for more than &frac14; of all the net neutrality comments received by the FCC during its feedback process, and were behind the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><b>Internet Slowdown</b></a> protest, which was supported by more than 40,000 websites including some of the largest on the Web like Kickstarter, Etsy, Netflix, and Tumblr.  </p><p>The group also helped take the fight for net neutrality into the streets with creative protest campaigns like <a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><b>Occupy the FCC</b></a> and the nationwide <b><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2014/11/7/headlines/internet_emergency_protests_across_us_condemn_latest_net_neutrality_plan" target="_blank">Internet Emergency</a> </b>protests. </p><p>Fight for the Future is continuing to work on defending net neutrality and the open Internet, as well as running campaigns against mass government surveillance, online censorship, and the secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, which contains problematic copyright provisions that will negatively impact Internet users’ right to freedom of expression.</p><p>###</p>

As Monday morning the video has already been viewed more than <b>360,000 times</b>. The campaign has already generated more than <b>86,000</b> comments before the Copyright Office’s Friday deadline, and has since collected an additional <b>11,000</b>, which will be delivered to the Copyright Office as a petition. The comments are in support of stronger fair use and free speech protections in the DMCA. Before the launch of the campaign last week, the Copyright Office had only received 80 (yes, eighty) comments. As of March 2nd, they had <b><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=COLC-2015-0013-0001" target="_blank">only received</a> </b>23. </p><p>The flood of new submissions late last week<b> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VP8n5a0.png" target="_blank">repeatedly crashed</a></b> the<b> <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=COLC-2015-0013-0002" target="_blank">website</a></b> that the government set up to receive feedback. Given that this site is the only method for concerned Internet users to submit comments, Fight for the Future is calling on the Copyright Office to consider the additional comments that came in after the deadline.</p><p>“The DMCA affects all Internet users and they should have an opportunity to express their concerns with the ways content is censored from the Internet, causing damage to free speech that can&rsquo;t be undone,” <b>said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future, </b>“The Copyright Office has a responsibility to make sure these voices are heard.”</p><p>“Copyright laws are among the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the digital age,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. </b>“Taking down content from the Internet en masse doesn’t benefit artists and individual creators, it benefits large corporations. I supported my family as a musician for years before coming to Fight for the Future, and I believe creators should be compensated for their work. But the Internet is the best thing to ever happen to creative people and independent artists. We need to fight to defend it from those pushing censorship in our names,” she added.</p><p> &ldquo;We need to have real open discussions on how to adapt copyright law and the DMCA to account for the modern Internet,&rdquo; <b>said Michael Michaud, who made the video for ChannelAwesome, </b>“While we&rsquo;re sure the DMCA is being used the right way at times, it&rsquo;s also being used to silence speech, hold videos hostage, steal, and destroy content creators.  It&rsquo;s also being used by companies that fail to account for Fair Use.&ldquo;</p><p>Follow Fight for the Future<b> <a href="http://twitter.com/fightfortheftr" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> </b>for breaking updates on this campaign, and contact <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><b>press@fightforthefuture.org</b></a> if you’d like to schedule an interview.</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit with more than 1.4 million members that works to defend the Internet as an open and powerful platform for freedom of expression.
