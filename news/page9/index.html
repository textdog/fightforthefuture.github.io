The measure already passed the Senate last week, so it will now head to the President’s desk for signing.<br/></p><p>Yesterday, digital rights group <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, known for organizing massive protests against SOPA and for net neutrality announced that they will put up <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-03-27-fight-for-the-future-to-unleash-billboards-to/" target="_blank">billboards</a> with the names of every member of Congress who voted to sell off their constituent’s privacy rights.</p><p>“Today Congress proved once again that they care more about the wishes of the corporations that fund their campaigns than they do about the safety and security of their constituents,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. </p><p>“Gutting these privacy rules won’t just allow Internet Service Providers to spy on us and sell our personal information, it will also enable more unconstitutional mass government surveillance, and fundamentally undermine our cybersecurity by making our sensitive personal information vulnerable to hackers, identity thieves, and foreign governments,” she added.</p><figure data-orig-width="1066" data-orig-height="680" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/fc0f3f4f64874df1cc4d4ca882200a2f/tumblr_inline_onjn0ux5HR1ri3xd7_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1066" data-orig-height="680"/></figure><p>The group released a draft <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fN5wy" target="_blank">mock-up</a> of what the initial billboard &ndash; which will be unveiled in Washington, DC and in select districts &ndash; will look like, with the names of the 50 Senators who voted for the bill last week. Today they <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/846758193162260481" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a mock-up of a billboard targeting Rep Marsha Blackburn, who has taken nearly $700,000 in contributions from telecom companies over her career. </p><p>“Congress should know by now that when you come for the Internet, the Internet comes for you,” Greer added, “these billboards are just the beginning. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, and every lawmaker who votes to take away our privacy will regret it come election day.”</p><p>The public backlash following the party-line vote in the Senate clearly had an impact, as 15 Republicans broke ranks to vote against the controversial measure.</p><p>By using the CRA to gut the FCC broadband privacy rules, lawmakers voted to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections" target="_blank">allow</a> ISPs to:</p><p>-Monitor and sell customer’s location data, search history, app usage, and browsing habits to advertisers without your permission</p><p>-Hijack customer’s search results, redirecting their traffic to paying third parties<br/></p><p>-Insert ads into web pages that would otherwise not have them</p><p>Fight for the Future was instrumental in the massive grassroots campaign that successfully pushed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the strongest net neutrality protections in US. history last year.

When ISPs collect and store this information, they will also be making it available to the Federal government and law enforcement through bulk surveillance programs.</p><p>The measure passed the Senate last week, and it was a strict party line vote with 50 members of the GOP voting to gut the rules. Given that many members of the House Freedom Caucus have taken strong previous stands for American’s right to privacy, it’s very important that we make sure they know that voters from across the spectrum want them to oppose this attack on our basic rights.

      <h1><a href="/news/2017-03-23-breaking-senate-votes-to-gut-broadband-privacy/">BREAKING: Senate Votes to Gut Broadband Privacy Rules</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:26 EDT on March 23, 2017</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, March 23, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2>Statement from digital rights group Fight for the Future on Senate use of Congressional Review Act to sell Internet users’ personal information to the highest bidder</h2><p>Today, the U.S. Senate <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/844960226218590208" target="_blank">voted</a> to use the Congressional Review Act to gut the FCC’s broadband privacy rules that prevent Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from selling their customer’s personal information to advertisers without permission. <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, a leading digital rights group that played an instrumental role in securing the FCC rules last year, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer (pronouns: she/her):</p><blockquote><p><i>“Today, 50 members of the U.S. Senate voted to sell their constituents most personal information to the highest bidder. </i></p><p><i>They used a blatantly undemocratic Congressional procedure to gut basic protections that prevent Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from selling their customers personal information to marketers without their permission.</i></p><p><i>These lawmakers &ndash; many of whom accept large campaign contributions from the industry groups who lobbied for this move &ndash; should be ashamed that they allowed partisan politics and corporate corruption to strip Internet users of our right to use the web safely and privately. <br/></i><i><br/>The controversial measure passed by a narrow margin. This is evidence that many members of Congress are still scared of angering the Internet. And they should be. Internet users are increasingly aware of how legislation and FCC rules impact our basic rights, and we are prepared to fight to defend them.<br/></i><i><br/>The Senators who voted today to sell out their constituents privacy will soon learn that the money they get from Cable companies can’t buy back our trust.”</i></p></blockquote><p>By using the CRA to gut the FCC broadband privacy rules, Senators voted to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections%20" target="_blank">allow</a> ISPs to:</p><ul><li>Monitor and sell all your location data, search history, app usage, and browsing habits to advertisers without your permission</li><li>Hijack your search results, redirecting your traffic to paying third parties</li><li>Insert ads into web pages that would otherwise not have them<br/></li></ul><p>Fight for the Future was instrumental in the massive grassroots campaign that successfully pushed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the strongest net neutrality protections in US. history last year.
