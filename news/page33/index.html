        <span class="date">Posted 05:31 EDT on October 23, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3559" data-orig-width="5339"><img data-orig-height="3559" data-orig-width="5339" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nwo2esE4mn1ri3xd7_540.jpg?1506019143369"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 23, 2015</p><p>Contact: Holmes Wilson, 614-465-6371, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>WASHINGTON, DC––Thursday night a group of Internet freedom activists gathered outside the U.S. Capitol building to send a clear message to Congress using glowing light-up signs: “NO CISA.”</p><p><b>See PHOTOS here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/kaUYl" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/kaUYl</a></b> </p><p><i>(These photos are available for use by press, please credit to Fight for the Future.)</i></p><p>The “NO CISA” protest outside Congress was organized on 24 hours notice by Fight for the Future, CODEPINK, Restore the Fourth, American Arab Anti-Discrimination Council, Defending Dissent, and Bill of Rights Defense Committee who reacted quickly when news broke that the controversial Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) was moving on the Senate floor. </p><p>While Web activists gathered IRL in Washington, DC, tens of thousands more are speaking out online. In recent weeks Fight for the Future alone has driven tens of thousands of phone calls and emails to Congress opposing the bill through their action page <b><a href="http://decidethefuture.org" target="_blank">DecideTheFuture.org</a>,</b> which also features interactive scorecards grading both members of Congress and major U.S. tech companies on their positions on privacy issues. </p><p>The hashtag #CISA has also been <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CISA?src=hash" target="_blank"><b>completely flooded</b></a> with tweets opposing the bill. </p><p>Back in July, the Fight for the Future and other groups generated more than <b><a href="http://faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank">6.2 million faxes</a> </b>to members of Congress, although it appears that the Senate <b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3pjmb7/the_senate_lost_hundreds_of_thousands_of_faxes/" target="_blank">may have blocked</a> </b>or otherwise lost the vast majority of them, a disturbing footnote given the disconnect between Congress’ discussions of the bill and the overwhelming public opposition.</p><p>“The U.S. government’s deplorable surveillance programs and pathetic cybersecurity have already severely damaged the public’s trust in tech companies and their members of Congress,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“If they choose to ignore the blatantly overwhelming opposition to this bill and pass it anyway, that damage could become irreparable. This moment will go down in history, and politicians need to decide which side of history they want to be on: the side that fought for freedom or the side that gave it away.”</p><p>The bill, which has been lambasted by security experts, privacy activists, and major tech companies, would give corporations legal immunity to share data with the U.S. government, a move that experts say would not prevent cyber attacks but could enable sweeping new levels of government surveillance.</p><p>A final vote is expected on Tuesday.</p><p><b>Background:</b></p><p>Fight for the Future and a coalition of other advocacy groups have lead a series of high profile campaigns sparking massive public outrage against the bill. Earlier this year they launched <a href="https://www.faxbigbrother.com/" target="_blank">Operation: #FaxBigBrother</a>, generating more than <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/activists-send-the-senate-6-million-faxes-to-oppose-cyber-bill/" target="_blank">6 million faxes</a> to Senate offices lambasting CISA with the message that “Congress is stuck in 1984.” They also launched a <a href="http://decidethefuture.org" target="_blank">legislative “scoreboard”</a> that grades every member of Congress on their recent surveillance voting record and encourages visitors to contact their lawmakers to oppose CISA. </p><p>The grassroots campaigns have sparked an avalanche of opposition from the tech industry as well. Over the weekend <a href="https://twitter.com/policy/status/656288688364609536" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/Yelp/status/655938689952976896" target="_blank">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/reddit/status/654714193040400384" target="_blank">reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wikimediapolicy/status/655179547994816512" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> weighed in against CISA. Last week, CCIA, an industry association representing tech giants Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon, Sprint, and others, also <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131222608488/breaking-trade-group-representing-google" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> slamming the bill. Mozilla, imgur, Wordpress, Craigslist, Namecheap, and hundreds of other companies have opposed CISA and similar information sharing legislation in the past.</p><p>Last month, the Business Software Alliance, which represents Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies, clarified that <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">it does not support</a> any of the three information sharing bills before Congress after Fight for the Future ran <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">a public campaign</a> called YouBetrayedUs that spurred a flurry of angry emails from consumers targeting companies that signed a BSA letter that appeared to support CISA. The group also initiated a <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/heroku" target="_blank">boycott of Heroku</a>, the webhosting service owned by Salesforce, which prompted Salesforce’s CEO to <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/129854286868/breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo" target="_blank">take to twitter</a> condemning the BSA letter and saying his company opposes CISA. </p><p>The group continued to make headlines by calling for the <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/130360813438/fight-for-the-future-calls-for-experian-ceo-to" target="_blank">CEO of Experian to resign</a> over his company’s support for CISA after a devastating hack exposed the private data of 15 million T-Mobile customers.

Senators that expect to maintain their constituents trust would do well to take note of the rising level of opposition to this toxic legislation, which is now only supported by a few self-interested corporations and lawmakers who have a track record of voting to expand and maintain unpopular government surveillance programs.</p><p>###</p><p>Fight for the Future is a grassroots advocacy group with more than 1.4 million members that fights to protect the Internet as a powerful platform for freedom of expression and social change.

        <span class="date">Posted 12:40 EDT on October 22, 2015</span>


        <p>On Tuesday, 
October 27, the European Parliament will vote on rules intended to 
protect network neutrality in the European Union (EU). However, the 
proposal about to be adopted fails to deliver real network neutrality to the 
EU and is much weaker than current rules in the United 
States. <br></p>
<p><b>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s not too late to change course.</b> Members of 
Parliament can still secure meaningful network neutrality for 
Europe&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;if they adopt key amendments on Tuesday.</p>
<p><b>Want to help? <a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Click here to send an email to the European Parliament.</a> <br></b></p>
<p><b>Or <a href="http://savetheinternet.eu" target="_blank">click here to make a phone call</a>.<br></b></p>
<p>Did you do it? Awesome! Now keep reading to learn more, from a leading expert on Net Neutrality&hellip;</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 20:01 EDT on October 21, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="519" data-orig-width="956"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/01fe807f6a93cc7e534d695b546ea29c/tumblr_inline_nwlhm7QM0m1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="519" data-orig-width="956"/></figure><p>A video from October 15th has recently emerged showing Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) seemingly confused by a question about the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, and admitting that he has not yet read the bill, which is currently on the Senate floor and expected to come to a crucial vote within days.<br/></p><p><b>View the video here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/1505163873142638/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/internet2016/videos/1505163873142638/</a></b> </p><p>“I will confess that that is not a bill that I have studied,” Cruz responded when asked by an audience member about the controversial bill at an event in Kalona, Iowa. He went on to express that he has privacy concerns about data collection “across the board” but reiterated “I have not examined that particular bill.”</p><p>Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng had this to say in response to the video, “Ted Cruz’s confused response about CISA underscores the fact that Congress has no clue what they are voting on, and even less of a clue how to actually address critical cybersecurity issues. Security experts, tech companies who actually deal with cyber attacks, and privacy advocates all agree this bill is not only flawed but dangerous. I sincerely hope that Ted Cruz and the rest of Congress can take some time out of their busy campaigning schedules to actually read this bill before they vote on it.”</p><p>Feel free to reach out to us for more. We’re working on getting a version of the video up on YouTube to make it easier to embed.</p><p>Best,</p><p>-Evan at FFTF</p><p><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> </p><p>P.S.

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-21-fight-for-the-future-launches-corporate/">Fight for the Future launches “Corporate Scorecard” grading major tech companies on whether they publicly fight for user privacy</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 08:13 EDT on October 21, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>23 major tech companies oppose CISA, while 12 support it or are silent</i></h2><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 21st, 2015</p><p>Contact: Holmes Wilson, 614-465-6371, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Digital rights group Fight for the Future has launched a “Corporate Scorecard” that grades more than 30 of the world’s largest technology companies based on their public positions on key U.S. policy questions affecting Internet users’ privacy and security.</p><p><b>View the scorecard here: <a href="https://www.decidethefuture.org/#corporate" target="_blank">https://www.decidethefuture.org/#corporate</a></b></p><p>The scorecard divides companies into two groups, “Team Internet” and “Team NSA,” based on their stated positions. It grades companies on three current policy questions: Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) reform, support or opposition for government backdoors in encryption, and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), which just hit the Senate floor last night.</p><p>“People trust these companies with a staggering amount of personal information, and we need ways to hold them accountable to ensure they keep our data safe from both attackers and the government,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future.</b> “It’s not enough for companies to employ basic security practices, they need to be actively fighting for their users’ basic rights when key policy questions come up. Politicians constantly claim the support of the tech industry when attempting to undermine our privacy, so these companies have a responsibility to fight back.”</p><p>To be included on “Team Internet” a company must receive a “star” on all three issues. The scorecard only considered public statements made by companies in official blog posts, tweets, to the media, or via their industry associations. Remaining silent on essential policy questions that affect a company’s users was also counted against that company’s score. Companies that took a particularly strong stand, issuing their own statement rather than through an industry association, received a special seal denoting that they went “above and beyond.”</p><p>The scorecard shows that the majority of technology companies are aligned with their users in opposing policy that would lead to more government surveillance. 23 of the companies, for example, oppose CISA, including Google, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter, Yahoo, Yelp, Netflix, Amazon, Ebay, Wikipedia, and Dropbox. Apple and Dropbox joined this list yesterday, when they came out <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/10/20/apple-says-its-against-a-key-cybersecurity-bill-days-before-a-crucial-vote/?ooiuoiuer" target="_blank">unequivocally</a> against CISA.</p><p>Internet Service Providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T received among the worst scores, ending up on “Team NSA” along with companies like Xerox, Priceline, and Expedia. IBM, LinkedIn, HP, and Intel also ended up on “Team NSA” primarily due to their support for or silence on CISA.</p><p>Fight for the Future has run multiple pressure campaigns in recent months calling on technology companies to take public positions on CISA.
