Numbers show that the majority of Congress members support reform, but leadership opposes it</i></p><p>As the battle over cybersecurity heats up in Congress, privacy advocates today launched a legislative ‘scoreboard’ that grades lawmakers on their commitment to surveillance reform. </p><p>See the scoreboard online here: <a href="http://decidethefuture.org" target="_blank">DecideTheFuture.org </a></p><p>The scoreboard builds off a similar tool released last year by <a href="http://standagainstspying.org" target="_blank">a coalition</a> of privacy advocates, adding data from the current Congress, including the PATRIOT Act renewal fight, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 and other relevant legislation.</p><p>“We wanted to develop something simple and easy that would allow users to quickly see which politicians oppose mass surveillance, and who’s working to expand the surveillance state” says Alex Marthews, national chair of Restore The Fourth. </p><p>The new online tool, which is a joint effort by Restore The Fourth and Fight for the Future, allows users to input their state and find their legislators’ voting records. Visitors to the site are encouraged to call, email or Tweet lawmakers to demand stronger surveillance reform. </p><p>All 535 members of Congress are graded. 24 Senators got A grades, and 35 got Fs. In the House, 173 Representatives (40%) got A grades, and 10 (2.3%) got Fs.</p><p>The scoreboard shows strong support for surveillance reform in Congress, especially in the House; but that leadership in both Houses and the intelligence committees are strongly slanted against reform.</p><p>“Ever since Edward Snowden exposed the NSA’s worst abuses, members of Congress from both political parties have been under intense pressure from the public to rein in the U.S. government’s runaway surveillance programs,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, “The scoreboard makes it impossible for them to hide any longer; politicians from both sides of the aisle who attempt to block meaningful reform on this issue should expect to pay the price come election time.”</p><p>Looking at the states, legislators from Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin are most supportive of surveillance reform, while legislators from Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois and Mississippi tend to oppose reform more. </p><p>With so many key elections coming up, this tool provides a platform for voters to get involved. As Congress prepares to make decisions affecting the nation’s privacy and safety, we should all be aware of who is and isn’t fighting for our Fourth Amendment rights.</p><p> # # #</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-09-25-breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo/">BREAKING: Facing public backlash, Salesforce CEO backs away from pro-CISA position</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:49 EDT on September 25, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>Says letter supporting cyber threat sharing legislation was “a mistake” and that he’s “against it”</i></h2><p><i>UPDATE: The entire Business Software Alliance, representing Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Adobe, and others, has now <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> clarifying that it does not support CISA.</i></p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>September 25, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer,<br/><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, 978-852-6457</p><p>BREAKING: After digital rights group Fight for the Future’s <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">YouBetrayedUs.org</a> campaign sparked public outcry and generated more than 23,000 emails and <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/heroku" target="_blank">calls for a boycott</a>, the CEO of cloud computing firm Salesforce took to twitter today to clarify that his company does not support CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.<br/></p><p>CISA is a controversial “cybersecurity” bill that <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/oti/coalition-letter-from-55-civil-society-groups-security-experts-and-academics-opposing-cisa/" target="_blank">experts say</a> will endanger online privacy and security while failing to stop cyber attacks. Last week, Salesforce and a handful of other companies including Microsoft and Apple  <a href="http://www.bsa.org/~/media/Files/Policy/data/09142015CongLeadershipDataAgendaLetter.pdf" target="_blank">signed on to letter</a> sent to Congress by BSA, The Software Alliance. The letter urges “prompt action” by Congress to pass “Cyber Threat Information Sharing Legislation.” Given that the Senate is expected to take up CISA soon, and that CISA is the only “Cyber Threat Information Sharing Legislation” being considered, the letter was seen as a clear endorsement of the bill, sparking online outrage.</p><p>“The letter clearly was a mistake and doesn&rsquo;t imply CISA support. We need to clarify. I&rsquo;m against it,” Marc Benioff <a href="https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/647431090400010240" target="_blank">tweeted</a> today. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/647422363890544640" target="_blank">separate tweet</a> he clarified, “Contrary to reports, Salesforce doesn’t support the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA.)” He also linked to <a href="http://trust.salesforce.com" target="_blank">trust.salesforce.com</a>, a page that does not appear to mention CISA or other Salesforce policy positions. Benioff appeared to spend quite a bit of time on twitter this morning, replying to many twitter users who had tweeted about Salesforce’s support for misguided cybersecurity legislation.</p><p>“It’s great to see the Internet flexing its muscles and showing its power to defend itself once again,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, “Salesforce responding to our boycott by backing away from support for CISA is a huge victory for the rights of Internet users everywhere. Any company that expects its users&rsquo; trust must clearly and vocally oppose CISA and any bill like it.”</p><p>###</p><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights group best known for organizing massive online protests <a href="http://sopastrike.com/" target="_blank">against SOPA</a> and for <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">net neutrality</a>. They were also behind <a href="http://resetthenet.org/" target="_blank">Reset the Net</a>, the largest online campaign against mass surveillance, which was endorsed by Edward Snowden and thousands of tech companies.

The public backlash has come with a simple message: “You betrayed us.”</p><p>Digital rights group <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, known for its major role in the battle against SOPA and the net neutrality victory, launched <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/" target="_blank">YouBetrayedUs.org</a> yesterday after a handful of technology companies began publicly lobbying for Congress to pass “Cyber Threat Information Sharing Legislation,” known in its current form as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA).</p><p>Fight for the Future, who are currently Heroku / Salesforce webhosting customers, simultaneously <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/heroku" target="_blank"><b>published an open letter</b></a> announcing their intention to leave that service for a provider who does not support privacy-killing legislation, and calling for a general Internet boycott of Heroku, an idea that <b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3lzouy/why_were_leaving_heroku/" target="_blank">quickly spread</a> </b>on popular sites among web developers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3m15gf/why_were_leaving_heroku/" target="_blank">like <b>reddit</b></a><b> </b>and <b><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10261397" target="_blank">yCombinator</a>.</b></p><p><b>The letter, penned by Fight for the Future’s CTO Jeff Lyon, reads, </b>“Salesforce is actively supporting a bill that would undermine &hellip; trust. If CISA passes, it will be impossible for us to guarantee our own privacy policy with our users, because Heroku may broadly violate their privacy agreement with us to share information about our users with the government.”</p><p>“Any company that supports a bill  like CISA or sits silently and allows it to pass is a company that can’t be trusted,” <b>added Fight for the Future’s campaign director, Evan Greer,</b> “These companies might think they’re invincible, but so did Myspace and Friendster. Internet users are fed up, companies that abandon their commitment to user privacy and security should expect the Internet to abandon them.”</p><p>The <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank"><b>YouBetrayedUs.org</b></a> campaign is just getting started. Fight for the Future plans to continue exposing companies that support anti-user legislation like CISA, and will work to get every popular website and tech company on the record about this crucial legislation. Many popular companies<b> <a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank">have opposed</a> </b>bills like CISA including reddit, Imgur, Namecheap, Wordpress, and Mozilla. </p><p>This list will continue to grow as companies realize that their user’s expect them not just to take basic security precautions, but to actively fight for their privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 20:52 EDT on August 18, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1564" data-orig-width="2149"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/e3c5b1bb05035f41b5fe9bf8f73b76e7/tumblr_inline_ntb3pl93pQ1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1564" data-orig-width="2149"/></figure><p><b>For Immediate Release</b>: August 18, 2015<br/><b>Contact</b>: Christina DiPasquale, 202.716.1953, <a href="mailto:Christina@fitzgibbonmedia.com" target="_blank">Christina@fitzgibbonmedia.com</a><br/><br/><i>Conviction Can Be Used Against Manning During Any Clemency or Parole Hearing Forever; Expects to Delay Transition to Minimum Security Custody By Years</i></p><p>Today, Chelsea Manning called supporters from prison to inform them that the U.S. Army found her guilty of all four “charges,” which include possession of LGBTQ reading material like the Caitlyn Jenner issue of Vanity Fair, and having a tube of expired toothpaste in her cell. She received 21 days of recreational restrictions, excluding her from time in the gym, library and outdoors. Now that they convictions are on her record, they can be cited in future hearings concerning parole or clemency. Manning expects the convictions to delay her transition to minimum security custody status <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/633787572884492288" target="_blank">by years</a>. </p><p><b>Chase Strangio, Chelsea’s attorney at the ACLU, said:</b></p><p>“When I spoke to Chelsea earlier today she wanted to convey the message to supporters that she is so thankful for the thousands of people from around the world who let the government know that we are watching and scrutinizing what happens to her behind prison walls. It was no doubt this support that kept her out of solitary confinement. But the fact that Chelsea had to face today&rsquo;s four-hour Disciplinary Board without counsel, and will now be punished for daring to share her voice, sets a concerning precedent for the remaining decades of her incarceration. Not only does this punishment mean the immediate loss of library and recreation for Chelsea, but she also will carry these infractions through her parole and clemency process and will be held longer in the more restrictive custody where she is now incarcerated. No one should have to face the lingering threat of solitary confinement for reading and writing about the conditions we encounter in the world. Chelsea&rsquo;s voice is critical to our public discourse about government accountability and trans Justice and we can only preserve it if we stay vigilant in our advocacy on her behalf.”  </p><p>Chelsea Manning faced a possible maximum penalty of indefinite solitary confinement and petitions signed by 100,000 were delivered today by digital rights group <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, <a href="http://act.rootsaction.org/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11573" target="_blank">RootsAction.org</a>, <a href="https://act.demandprogress.org/sign/us-government-chelsea-manning-charges" target="_blank">Demand Progress</a>, and <a href="http://www.codepink.org/demand_justice_for_chelsea_manning" target="_blank">CodePink</a>.</p><p>Photos of petition delivery: <b><a href="http://imgur.com/a/IKtWF" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/IKtWF</a></b> </p><p><b>Evan Greer, Campaign Director of Fight for the Future, said</b>:</p><p>&ldquo;People around the world are outraged that a courageous whistleblower like Chelsea Manning is imprisoned in the first place, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that people spoke out in droves when the U.S. government threatened her. More than 100,000 supporters signed a petition demanding no solitary confinement for Chelsea, and the pressure worked. It&rsquo;s absurd that Chelsea was found guilty, and that she has to endure any additional punishment beyond being wrongly imprisoned, but now the U.S. government knows that the world is watching their treatment of Chelsea closely. If they continue this unwarranted harassment of Chelsea, they risk losing all legitimacy in the eyes of millions.&rdquo;</p><p>The charges were first revealed at <a href="http://freechelsea.com/" target="_blank">FreeChelsea.com</a>, and Manning has since posted the original charging documents to her twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631953441779138561" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631954178332487680" target="_blank">here</a>. She has also posted the complete list of confiscated reading materials <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/632247137112207360" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>###</p>
