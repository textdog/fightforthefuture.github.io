        <span class="date">Posted 13:52 EDT on July 31, 2014</span>


        <p><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n9l8c4JMSV1ri3xd7.png?1506019147325"/></span></p>

<p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>July 31, 2014<br/><br/>Media contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: </span><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span>press@fightforthefuture.org</span></a></p>
<p><span><strong>Organizers of largest ever effort to secure the web against mass surveillance announce next phase of “Reset the Net</strong>”</span></p>
<p><em>Fight for the Future, the digital rights group behind last month’s successful “Reset the Net” campaign, vow to announce new participants and actions each month to spread the use of encryption technology and make more and more of the web off-limits to mass surveillance.</em></p>
<p><span>Today, organizers of the </span><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Reset the Net</a></strong><span> campaign unveiled the latest advances in Internet’s collective push to block out mass government surveillance. This month’s participants include smartphone retailer </span><strong>GSM Nation</strong><span> who will add educational Reset the Net inserts to phones they ship, domain registrar </span><strong>Namecheap</strong><span> who launched </span><strong><a href="http://switchtossl.com" target="_blank">SwitchToSSL.com</a></strong><span> to encourage more sites to encrypt, </span><span><strong>reddit</strong>, </span><span>who pledged to run free ads for privacy startups, and the </span><strong>Student Net Alliance</strong><span> who announced a campaign to grade campuses based on their Internet freedom and privacy policies.</span></p>
<p><span>“Last month it was clear that the resounding echoes of the Reset the Net launch had been heard in the chambers of Congress when the House voted to pass amendments that would have meaningfully reined in NSA and FBI spying,” </span><strong>said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future,</strong><span> “But the Senate voted to kill those amendments, and the latest version of the USA Freedom Act contains dangerously vague language that could potentially worsen the status quo. By dragging their feet on this issue, Congress is forcing the public to take matters into their own hands. They’re saying: encrypt or get spied on. What choice do we have?” </span></p>
<p><span>Reset the Net was launched last month on June 5th, the anniversary of the first Snowden revelation in The Guardian and Washington Post. The campaign </span><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/was-epic-reset-net/" target="_blank">reached billions of people</a></strong><span> and involved the largest websites on earth including Wordpress, Twitter, Google, Tumblr, Wikipedia, reddit, Mozilla, and Minecraft. As part of the effort, many sites pledged to add SSL, HSTS, and Perfect Forward Secrecy to their sites to protect user privacy, while others helped promote the free and open source encryption tools in the Reset the Net </span><strong><a href="http://pack.resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Privacy Pack</a></strong><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Edward Snowden endorsed the campaign during a </span><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWzNy2-MlFQ#t=18" target="_blank">video appearance</a></strong><span> on June 5th, saying, “We’re past the point where citizens are entirely dependent on governments to defend our rights. We don’t have to ask for our privacy, we can take it back.” He also submitted a </span><strong><a href="http://resetthenet.tumblr.com/post/87793640365/edward-snowdens-statement-in-support-of-reset-the-net" target="_blank">written statement</a></strong><span> in support of the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span>Reset the Net organizers vow to announce a new round of participants each month, and to continue escalating their demands on governments and corporations to end mass suspicionless surveillance.</span></p>
<p><span>This month’s Reset the Net announcements:</span></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>GSM Nation, a major phone retailer, announced that they will join Reset the Net by including a physical “privacy pack” insert in thousands of mobile devices that they ship </strong><span>to educate customers about free and open source applications they can use to protect their mobile privacy. They also announced that they will soon be offering the privacy-conscious Blackphone, as part of an ongoing collaboration with Fight for the Future.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leading domain registrar Namecheap launched <a href="http://switchtossl.com" target="_blank">SwitchToSSL.com</a></strong><span>, a one stop website in partnership with Reset the Net that makes it easy and cheap for webmasters to protect their visitors’ privacy by adding SSL encryption to their sites for just $1.99 (of which $1 is donated to Fight for the Future to support the campaign.) During the June launch of Reset the Net, Namecheap distributed more than 6,000 SSL certificates, organizers set a goal of 10,000 by the end of August. </span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Net Alliance, a new international network of student-run Internet freedom groups, announced the launch of the Campus Internet Policy Gradebook</strong><span>, which will grade colleges and universities’ policies based on 10 criteria including how they manage student data, relationships with NSA and other agencies, free speech protections, student intellectual property rights, transparency reporting, and encryption of data. Student organizers will be collecting data this Fall and launching campaigns based on their findings. <strong>More on Student Net Alliance </strong></span><strong><a href="https://www.studentnetalliance.org" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>reddit, “the front page of the Internet” with more than 115 million monthly visitors, committed to continue running free advertisements for privacy startups</strong><span> to give a boost to the many new easy-to-use encryption technologies that have been developed since the Snowden revelations.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Open Whisper Systems this week</strong> </span><strong><a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal/" target="_blank">unveiled Signal</a>, a free and open source app allowing for worldwide encrypted phone calls on iPhone.</strong><span> They further announced that Signal will become one unified app that will replace TextSecure and RedPhone on Android, and will soon have a browser extension option, allowing for user friendly end-to-end encrypted communication on nearly any device. <br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Below are statements from some of this month’s Reset the Net participants:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Laura Harrison Director of Marketing at GSM Nation said, </strong><span>&ldquo;We believe that everyone should have the right to keep their personal information private, including information stored on their mobile devices. To that end, we&rsquo;re excited to partner with Fight For the Future to educate users who purchase cell phones from GSM Nation about the steps they can take to keep their mobile devices secure. By implementing these suggestions, mobile users can begin taking steps to protect their information from prying eyes.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We were proud to support the first push for Reset the Net in June, where we helped distribute thousands of SSL certificates,” </span><span>s<strong>aid Richard Kirkendall, CEO of Namecheap</strong></span><span><strong>,</strong> “All of us here at Namecheap believe deeply in the importance of a free and open Internet. We&rsquo;re glad to be a positive part of the solution to enhance internet privacy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Last month, hundreds of students came together to protest mass surveillance on college campuses. But some of the most egregious violations of privacy are committed by the universities themselves, &rdquo; </span><strong>said Alec Foster, Executive Director of Student Net Alliance</strong><span><strong>,</strong> &ldquo;That’s why we’re announcing the Campus Internet Policy Gradebook: a resource to not only help students learn about innovation and privacy policies at their schools, but to let students compare their school’s policies to other institutions. In addition, the recommendations for improvement can help students identify and work to change problematic policies on campus.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Repairing the damage that the NSA has done to our online privacy isn&rsquo;t something you can accomplish in a day, it&rsquo;s going to take time,&rdquo; </span><strong>said Erik Martin, general manager of reddit,</strong><span> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been an exciting surge in the development of easy-to-use privacy technology in the wake of the Snowden revelations, we aim to do our part to get those tools into the hands of everyday Internet users who want to protect themselves from illegal surveillance.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 18:35 EDT on July 30, 2014</span>


        <p><span>Hey there, </span></p>
<p><span>Got two seconds to help? </span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/disconnectvote" target="_blank">Please vote for Fight for the Future for Disconnect’s charity of the month!</a><br/><br/></strong><span>Exciting news! The Fight for the Future community is growing.</span><span> We now have more than 1 million members who are spread out all over the world</span><span>, and come from nearly every political viewpoint. Our love for the free and open Internet unites us.<br/><br/>While we’ve been growing our ranks, we’ve been keeping our team small and our costs low. There’s still just six of us running FFTF with the help of an amazing network of volunteers, coalition partners, and co-conspirators.</span></p>
<p><span>Many of you have funded our work. We&rsquo;ve been excited to report how we use our resources creatively &ndash; we go big or go home. </span><span>Just this year we:</span><span><br/></span></p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>occupied the FCC building for 10 days</span></a><span>, putting Title II net neutrality on the map and drawing international headlines, and then we launched Battleforthenet.com and broke the FCC’s website with a deluge of comments <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">just before the deadline.</a></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>organized </span><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><span>Reset the Net</span></a><span>, the <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/was-epic-reset-net/" target="_blank">largest effort yet </a></span><span>to shut down mass surveillance with technology. The campaign was endorsed </span><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/87856695073/a-message-from-edward-snowden-on-the-eve-of-reset-the" target="_blank"><span>by Edward Snowden</span></a><span> and reached billions of people.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>began development on an open source app and browser extension (that many of you helped fund!) that will allow us to send urgent alerts without using email when the Internet is threatened. Want to help? <a href="https://github.com/fightforthefuture/TeamFutureForFirefox" target="_blank">Check out the code on github</a> and get involved.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li><span>brought together an <a href="http://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">unprecedented coalition</a> of tech companies, labor unions, environmental groups, leftists and libertarians to oppose Fast Track and the Trans Pacific Partnership’s secretive internet censorship plan.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>won the prestigious </span><a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/6/23/19-projects-win-knight-news-challenge-strengthening-internet/" target="_blank"><span>Knight Foundation&rsquo;s prototype award</span></a><span> to build a global anti-censorship alert system. Helped crowdfund thousands of VPNs to send to activists fighting censorship in Turkey.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>pushed back on the expansion of corporate meddling in Internet freedom by rallying </span><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>against CISA </span></a><span>(the new CISPA), collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures against Facebook’s </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/facebookopt-out/" target="_blank"><span>abusive practices</span></a><span>, and <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/89888291608/net-neutrality-protesters-arrested-late-last-night-at" target="_blank">supporting Occupy Google</a></span><span> when they were arrested for free speech.</span></p>
</li>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/disconnectvote" target="_blank">Click here to vote for Fight for the Future for Disconnect’s charity of the month!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>It doesn’t cost anything, so it’s an awesome way to help even if you’re broke! You don’t have to log in or share your email or anything. It takes two seconds and it could help us receive thousands of dollars of much needed funding that we’ll immediately use to continue ramping up the fight for net neutrality, online privacy, and free expression.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re so proud of what we’ve accomplished together! All 1,247,000 (and counting) of us. Just as a reminder, we only want to email people who want to get our emails, so if you ever want to unsubscribe, we try to make it really easy. Just use the link at the bottom of all our emails.</span></p>

<p>The U.S. government didn&rsquo;t want the journalists at The Intercept to publish this article. Maybe that&rsquo;s because it shows that intelligence agencies can label people as terrorists for &hellip; pretty much anything they want.</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 21:19 EDT on July 22, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n954zzhbcC1ri3xd7.png?1506019147325"/></span></a></p>
<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future members.</span></p>
<p><span>We had a huge showing for real net neutrality last week &ndash; more than 1 million people submitted comments to the FCC, and millions more spoke out through <strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/tellfcc" target="_blank">petitions</a></strong>, phone <a href="http://dearfcc.org/call" target="_blank"><strong>calls</strong></a>, oh yeah, and by <strong><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">camping out</a></strong> on the FCC&rsquo;s doorstep.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><span>Our tiny team of staff and volunteers worked round the clock on <strong><a href="http://Battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Battleforthenet.com</a></strong> in the days leading up to the comment deadline, and when the dust settled we had personally delivered 130,000 comments to the FCC in just 3 days. </span><span>That’s more than 1/3 of all the comments delivered during that time!</span></span></p>
<p><span>I’m so proud of all of you. Our little organization is giving these Big Cable bullies a run for their money! <br/></span></p>
<p><span>But with the kind of money they’ve got, we can’t afford to just keep fighting, we’ve got to take this to the next level and get the whole Internet organized for a crucial day of action this September before the FCC’s decision.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=net-neutrality" target="_blank">Please chip in today to help us win the battle for net neutrality.</a></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Last year, corporations that oppose net neutrality spent more than $1.4 million EVERY WEEK on lobbying. [1] That’s more than Fight for the Future’s entire yearly budget. </span><span>For two years!</span></span></p>
<p><span>We’ve been winning campaigns since SOPA on the same formula: we keep our team small and our costs low, we focus on strategy, and we’re not afraid to say what must be said and go all out when the time is right.</span></p>
<p><span><span>This Fall the FCC will either decide to protect the Internet or fundamentally break it. </span><span>We’re going to do everything in our power to make sure the people win. <strong>Will you help?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=net-neutrality" target="_blank">Please click here to donate what you can.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The most exciting thing about this fight is that we’re not just trying to stop a bad bill like SOPA. If we succeed in getting the FCC to reclassify the Internet and enact real net neutrality, we’ll be protecting the Internet as a platform for the public good for generations to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all you’ve done. More soon.</span></p>
<p><span>-Tiffiniy, Evan, Holmes, and the whole FFTF team</span></p>
<p><span><span>P.S. If you donated (or if you can’t donate, or if you hate fundraising emails) </span><span>here’s the coolest cat on the Internet.<br/><br/></span><span><img alt="Coolest Cat" height="400" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/fftf-cms/media/medialibrary/2014/07/UDfIcf7.gif" width="400"/></span></span></p>

<p><em>Company that supports more than three million domain names says lasting net neutrality is essential to the Internet economy, encourages customers to submit comments to FCC before midnight deadline</em></p>
<p><span>With 12 hours to go before the new deadline that closes the first round of comments in the FCC&rsquo;s net neutrality proceeding, leading domain registrar Namecheap swooped in to strike hard on the side of an open Internet by launching </span><a href="http://netneutrality.com" target="_blank"><span>NetNeutrality.com</span></a><span>, an action site encouraging Internet users to continue bombarding the FCC with comments in support of Title II reclassification to protect the Internet in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC extended the original Wednesday comment deadline after various grassroots advocacy efforts like Fight for the Future’s BattleForTheNet.com action site flooded the FCC site with comments, causing it to go offline. As of Thursday July 17th, the FCC has received 1,030,000 comments, according to Gigi Sohn, Special Counsel for External Affairs for the FCC. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Over one million people depend on Namecheap to power their websites&rdquo; said Richard Kirkendall, Namecheap’s CEO and Founder, &ldquo;We have a moral responsibility to do everything we can as a company to defend the free and open Internet, ensuring that every single one of our customers can make their voice heard.”</span></p>
<p><span>“This is a crucial moment where we need every single voice raised demanding real net neutrality through Title II reclassification,” said Evan Greer, Campaign Manager at Fight for the Future. “Net neutrality is the free speech fight of our generation. It’s great to see so many voices, from huge sites to tiny blogs lining up to stand on Team Internet against any form of censorship online.”</span></p>
