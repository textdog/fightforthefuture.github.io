In an <b><a href="https://internetcreatorsguild.com/net-neutrality" target="_blank">open letter</a> </b>released today, creators warn that if the FCC slashes Title II – the strong legal foundation for U.S. net neutrality protections – the impacts of allowing Internet service providers to block, throttle, and charge fees would be immense for online video creators, many of whose audiences rival traditional media in size. </p><p>The letter, organized by the <b><a href="https://internetcreatorsguild.com" target="_blank">Internet Creators Guild</a>,</b> highlights the skyrocketing popularity in video traffic over the past decade, and warns that any weakening of the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order “&hellip;would have an outsized impact on our field and jeopardize our livelihood.” The letter&rsquo;s signatories, who collectively reach over 165 million people in their audiences, worry that a loss of net neutrality will give Internet service providers (ISPs) new influence over how online creators are able to grow their businesses. They argue that these protections are crucial to maintaining a level playing field. The organizers are encouraging more people to <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/fightforthefuture.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv_XFI8M_OCm7iiL70CpaGqNqDVC1FPU0JoMdA0SW43kRaEA/viewform" target="_blank">sign on</a>, as names are being added on rolling basis. </p><p>Notable signatories include:</p><p>1.

Anna Akana of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AnnaAkana" target="_blank">Anna Akana</a> (1.8 million subscribers)</p><p>“Strong, enforceable net neutrality protections are essential to ensure leading figures in online video can continue revolutionizing media and to give opportunities for new voices to gain momentum,” s<b>aid Laura Chernikoff, Executive Director of the Internet Creators Guild.</b> “Otherwise, deep-pocketed media giants who can afford privileged, fast lane access to customers would empowered to drown out the dynamic and growing industry of internet creators.”</p><p>The letter also highlights support for net neutrality policies from an overwhelming majority of <b><a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/net-neutrality/majority-of-americans-endorse-net-neutrality-protections/" target="_blank">Americans</a>,</b> and comes just days in advance of a July 12th Internet-Wide <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank"><b>Day of Action</b></a> to Save Net Neutrality. Over 50,000 people and thousands of websites have already joined the online protest, including web giants such as Amazon, Reddit, Netflix, OkCupid, Mozilla, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, and many others. </p><p>The signatories plan to leverage their online reach to encourage their audiences and the American to speak out for strong net neutrality protections. The letter states, “We’re in this for the long-haul. We will fight for as long as it takes to convince you and your colleagues to oppose any legislation or regulatory changes that would threaten real, enforceable Title II net neutrality.”</p><p><b>Laura Chernikoff, Executive Director of the Internet Creators Guild, said:</b> “Online creators and the American public have made their position loud and clear: we need real, enforceable net neutrality rules rooted in Title II of the Communications Act. This is the only way to ensure each of us can continue to live in a country where Internet users have an equal shot at reaching people and earning a living on the open web.”</p><p><b>Hank Green, Internet Creators Guild Advisor and creator of Vlogbrothers, SciShow, and CrashCourse said, </b>“So many individuals and corporations have been given such tremendous economic opportunities thanks to a neutral internet. I am one of them, and it hurts to think the opportunities I&rsquo;ve had might be denied to other people.”</p><p>This action is part of the <b><a href="https://internetcreatorsguild.com/" target="_blank">Internet Creators Guild’s</a> </b>efforts to advocate for and support creators. The non-profit organization was created in order to bring internet creators together to make their profession more sustainable. </p><p>###</p><p>CONTACT INFORMATION:<br/>Laura Chernikoff<br/>Executive Director, Internet Creators Guild<br/>+1-303-819-873<br/>laura@internetcreatorsguild.com</p>

Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.”</p><p><b>Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: </b>&ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”</p><p><b>Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said:</b> “Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”</p><p><b>Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said: </b>“The FCC&rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.”</p><p><b>Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said: </b>&quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said: </b>“It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.” </p><p><b>Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said: </b>&ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said:</b> &ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&rsquo;d put both us and our customers&rsquo; innovation at risk.&rdquo;</p><p>###</p>

It’s only right that lawmakers are now stepping in and calling for an investigation. </i></p><p><i>Regardless of their views on the FCC’s proceeding, every member of Congress should be concerned if their constituents’ identities are being stolen and used to submit comments to a Federal Agency without their permission, in ways that violate federal law and the privacy rights of the individuals affected.</i></p><p><i>The public needs to know who has been attempting to distort the record with these fraudulent comments, whether they were funded by the telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC’s attack on net neutrality protections, and whether leadership at the FCC knew about the operation and willfully decided to allow it to continue.</i></p><p><i>Federal Agencies have a responsibility to employ basic cybersecurity practices and act transparently to ensure that public comment proceedings have integrity and allow for meaningful input from the public. At this point, the FCC has clearly failed to maintain that integrity in this latest net neutrality proceeding. Members of Congress should work across the aisle to ensure that the agency addresses these serious cybersecurity issues before moving forward with an unpopular plan to dismantle consumer protections”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future is also one of the main organizations behind the massive July 12 Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality, <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/" target="_blank">which has attracted</a> </b>a wide range of prominent supporters including Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, Kickstarter, Etsy, Mozilla, Reddit, Pornhub, Soundcloud, and Vimeo. The group has been a leading voice calling for transparency and investigations into cybersecurity issues as the FCC for several months, and has compiled <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/" target="_blank">significant evidence</a> </b>of what appears to be a sophisticated astroturfing organization that is attempting to create the false impression of grassroots opposition to net neutrality protections.  </p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a digital rights group best known for organizing some of the largest online protests in history including the SOPA Blackout, Internet Slowdown, Reset the Net, and Rock Against the TPP.
