      <h1><a href="/news/2016-06-14-internet-activists-celebrate-historic-court-ruling/">Internet Activists Celebrate Historic Court Ruling for Net Neutrality</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:11 EDT on June 14, 2016</span>


        <h2>The DC Circuit has decided in favor of net neutrality in U.S. Telecom Association v. FCC.  This cements a decisive victory for the millions of people, companies, websites, and organizations who worked together to secure strong protections for the open Internet against one of the biggest lobbies in the United States. </h2><p>WASHINGTON––The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the Federal Communications Commission’s use of the legal authority behind its Open Internet Order today. The decision comes after a long-fought battle between major telecommunications services and millions of open Internet advocates from across the political spectrum. </p><p>Fight for the Future, the prominent digital rights group best known for their role in spearheading the <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">massive online and offline net neutrality protests</a>, including sit-ins in front of the FCC and the Internet Slowdown which broke a one-day comment submission record to the FCC, celebrates this dramatic victory. The Battle for the Net campaign, spearheaded by Fight for the Future, lead to over 4 million public comments submitted to the FCC, setting a new record for public engagement in a FCC proceeding. The campaign also generated more than 10 million emails to Congress, and 500,000 calls to Congress and the FCC.</p><p>Fight for the Future and many other civil rights and digital rights groups mobilized millions of people and thousands of companies to call on the FCC to use their legal authority to enact the most legally-defensible and strongest protections for net neutrality, which required the reclassification of ISP&rsquo;s as Title II Telecommunications services. The FCC, headed by Chairman Tom Wheeler, voted for the Open Internet Order in February 2015. The US Telecommunications Association brought a suit against this order shortly after. Now, over a year later, the DC Circuit has decided in favor of the FCC. The group’s representatives issued the following statements about today’s historic victory:</p><p>“In 2015, startups, investors, activists, academics, policymakers, and millions of individuals joined together in agreement that net neutrality was vitally important, and that Title II was the best, most legally sound way to do it.” said Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Fight for the Future. “Now, the courts agree with us too. This victory means that people all over the world can rely on smart policies in the US to protect the Internet as a platform for freedom of expression, economic growth, and social change.”</p><p>“The people have spoken. The courts have spoken. Cable giants like Comcast need to get over it and start actually providing great Internet service—not mounting these sneaky attacks in Congress, using lobbying dollars to turn Congress against the will of the people,” said Fight for the Future campaign director Evan Greer.</p><p>&ldquo;Today, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit confirmed what Fight for the Future and our allies have argued for years: The Federal Communications Commission has the power to apply the strongest powers it has in the interest of guaranteeing an open and free Internet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is the largest victory against monopolies this decade. Big telecom lost the number one handout they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying for over the last ten years,&rdquo; said Tiffiniy Cheng, Co-Director of Fight for the Future. &ldquo;They were able to skirt net neutrality rules by successfully lobbying the FCC to pretend they&rsquo;re not monopolies or telecommunications services. After four million people and thousands of companies worked tirelessly to show that this handout was bad for everyone but the ISPs, we were able to defeat one of the biggest and fiercest lobbies in the US. This watershed victory is testament to the ability of people to organize using the Internet against corruption and the status quo.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, all eyes turn towards Europe, where a coalition of activists and policy experts rallying as <a href="http://savetheinternet.eu" target="_blank">SaveTheInternet.eu</a> are in the final weeks of a years-long push for net neutrality rules covering the entire European Union. These coming weeks will determine whether European regulator BEREC matches or surpasses the US rules, or whether they fall short in the face of strong lobbying pressure from powerful European telecoms. Right now, BEREC has an open public consultation that runs until July 18th (analogous to the FCC comment periods which drew millions of submissions.) Fight for the Future will work with EU activists to launch a massive day of action to deliver hundreds of thousands of public comments to BEREC. </p><p>Additionally, the FCC is currently developing rules for zero rating plans, in particular. The FCC&rsquo;s Open Internet Order allowed an examination of zero ratings programs on a case by case basis. A letter from companies and organizations and 100,000’s of people has been sent to the FCC calling for an open process to examine these plans, including programs such as Comcast&rsquo;s preferential treatment for their own content, or AT&amp;T and Verizon&rsquo;s program that exclude paying websites from data caps.</p>

        <h2>Hundreds protest weak EU net neutrality proposals carrying giant speed limit signs and relegating Internet users to a &ldquo;slow lane.”</h2><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="507" data-orig-width="739"><img data-orig-height="507" data-orig-width="739" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_o8dwm3lbbw1u3ugzc_540.jpg?1506019141892"/></figure><p><b>View more photos here: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/akvorrat_at/albums/72157669189677326" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/akvorrat_at/albums/72157669189677326</a></b></p><p>Concerned Internet users and digital rights supporters gathered on Friday 6 June at the headquarters of the Austrian Telecom Regulator in Vienna (RTR, Mariahilferstraße 12-14, Vienna). This meeting helped to kick off a public consultation on net neutrality in the European Union that starts today and ends on July 21, 2016. </p><p>Photos submitted from protests can be seen here: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/akvorrat_at/albums/72157669189677326" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/akvorrat_at/albums/72157669189677326</a></p><p>The fight for net neutrality has moved from the United States, Brazil, India and now on to the European Union. As net neutrality policies are being decided around the world, what happens in the EU will have a major influence on how the US will deal with zero rating programs, which effectively create fast lanes for web content that pay against data caps, and on net neutrality policies that are being decided now in countries that have yet to have a similar fight. </p><p>“People are rallying in Vienna to defend the internet in the upcoming EU net neutrality rules. The public interest and the public voice must be heard.” said Thomas Lohninger, privacy activist at the civil liberties organisation AKVorrat. “Net neutrality is what has made the Internet thrive and grow all over the world, and the European union cannot lag behind. If we allow telecoms to treat Internet traffic differently based on who can pay, we will create an Internet with fast lanes and slow lanes, stifling free speech and innovation. If the rules are passed, we could be shutting down the next best invention for the world without even knowing it.”</p><p>Protesters opposed proposals to weaken net neutrality rules, holding &quot;Save the Net&rdquo; signs and unfurling a slow lane across the square to demonstrate what the Internet will be like for the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; in the future, along with traffic signs that read 56kb/s for everyone except paying corporations. </p><p>The rally was organized by several civil society organisations in Austria, including Netzfreiheit, AKVorrat, Wikimedia Austria, Open Knowledge Austria, and other advocacy organizations. </p><p>For the latest on upcoming events: SavetheInternet.EU</p><p>“The fight for net neutrality has arrived in Europe and we can&rsquo;t stand to lose protections for it. People care deeply about this issue and are even showing up in person to protest bad loopholes for telecoms,” said Lohninger. &ldquo;The whole world is watching EU’s ability to pass strong policy in the face of heavy industry lobbying, and people will be standing up in the coming days to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen. We won&rsquo;t allow the EU to turn out to be more lobbyist friendly on this key issue than the US or India.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because of the importance of the EU as a market, if we lose meaningful net neutrality there it will have a huge impact globally, both on the policy process in other countries but also on the course of the Internet itself. If the rules give an edge to big established sites with the ability to make special deals (e.g. Google and Facebook) that makes those sites harder to compete with, globally, and it will tilt the Internet’s future in the direction of big corporations&rdquo;, said Holmes Wilson, Co-Director of Fight for the Future.</p><p>For interviews with activists from the European Net Neutrality movement, please email<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=mailto%3Apress%40fightforthefuture.org&amp;t=MTdiZTRiMWIzOWJkNzdjNzUxN2RmYzEyMzAxZmVkYTgxYjI3OGNiNiwyZkpLVXpGSg%3D%3D" target="_blank"> press@fightforthefuture.org</a>.</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit with more than 1.4 million members that works to defend the Internet as an open and powerful platform for freedom of expression.

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-06-06-on-snowden-anniversary-end702-coalition-commits/">On Snowden Anniversary,  #End702 Coalition Commits to Fighting for the Expiration of Super Surveillance Law</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:55 EDT on June 6, 2016</span>


        <h2>As Congress begins discussion of Section 702, groups have united against the warrantless surveillance powers of that law, tipping debate towards its expiration.</h2><p>WASHINGTON &ndash;Today Fight for the Future and a bipartisan coalition of public interest groups launched <b><a href="http://www.end702.com/" target="_blank">end702.com</a></b>, a site calling for the expiration of Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, absent a full reform, in order to prevent warrantless mass surveillance of Americans. Section 702 is currently scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2017. </p><p>With Congress beginning hearings on the Section 702 program, including a Senate Judiciary hearing that was held in May, groups from the left and the right have come together in recent months to make their position clear—there can be no renewal of Sec 702 unless warrantless surveillance of Americans’ private lives is stopped. With growing skepticism across the US that Congress will be capable of passing a legitimate reform that protects the privacy and security of Americans, these groups are getting behind a sunset of the provision as the only realistic acceptable outcome. </p><p>Congress has been under pressure to address the government’s bulk collection of communications data after clandestine NSA surveillance programs, operating under the expanded definition of Section 702, were revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden three years ago today. Now that the expiration of Section 702 is approaching, Congress will be forced to address how the provision has been used against US residents and be counted in history as either continuing unprecedented warrantless mass surveillance or finally ending the law that enables it.</p><p>&ldquo;Now that we know how the government has abused the surveillance laws, Congress must start their review of Section 702 from where most Americans and organizations on the left and the right stand—the constitutional right of everyone to not be warrantlessly surveilled. If 702 in any form doesn&rsquo;t meet that mark, it has no place for continuation,&rdquo; said Fight for the Future co-director Tiffiniy Cheng.</p><p>Coalition members include Bill of Rights Defense Committee, Defending Dissent Foundation, Restore the Fourth, Human Rights Watch, Access Now, American Civil Liberties Union,  Government Accountability Project, Calyx, Roots Action, X-Lab, Arab American Institute, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Campaign for Liberty, Niskanen Center, Fight for the Future, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. </p><p>“The government’s mass surveillance is changing the way we as a society act,” said Sean Vitka, legislative counsel with Fight for the Future. “It is changing how we think and interact with the world. We must not allow the surveillance state to continue changing who we are, and that means ensuring that the Section 702 we know today expires.”</p><p>&ldquo;Since the Snowden revelations, polls and studies have shown that people care deeply about their privacy and security, have been self-censoring themselves, and have changed their behavior. As data and privacy become a business liability, and as more people are targeted for their race or religion based on this data, the government&rsquo;s programs on mass surveillance are becoming so politically toxic, most members of Congress or the White House will be embarrassed for supporting it.&rdquo; said Tiffiniy Cheng. </p><p><b>Background:</b></p><p>The Snowden disclosures revealed how the government has expanded the authority that Congress intended to provide in Section 702 to allow for the warrantless surveillance of millions of Americans and billions of people around the world. Under this law, intelligence agencies have collected Internet communications as they pass through the network to reach their destination without a warrant. Despite Section 702’s clear intention of allowing surveillance of persons “other than United States persons,” these agencies also claim the legal authority to search specifically for Americans within these enormous databases of information without a warrant.</p><p>For years, members of Congress and public interest groups have called for information about how deeply intelligence agencies penetrate into the private lives of Americans, and they have recently reupped their demands for more information. Intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice have not revealed how the government is using its mass surveillance powers. Without such information, the people and Congress cannot determine the benefits or the costs of the programs that the government claims are authorized under Section 702, much less determine how to fix their many problems.</p><p>Mass surveillance has already had profound negative effects on American society. Pew Research Center recently found that 30 percent of American adults have taken steps to hide their online activity from the government. Another study, published in Journalism and Mass Communications Quarterly, found that government surveillance is causing self-censorship of dissenting opinions. Further research indicates that government surveillance has caused writers to increase their self-censored and individuals to stop researching controversial issues. </p><p>Contact: <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=mailto%3Apress%40fightforthefuture.org&amp;t=Njg0YWVhNTljM2Y3NmE5MTBiOTEwNjBhNWViMTdjZDY2YmYzMjE4OSxZUmN6M01ObQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:18 EDT on May 24, 2016</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="474" data-orig-width="746"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b7042c7a811bdcf070abc8688d37f47/tumblr_inline_o7oyt91ry41ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="474" data-orig-width="746"/></figure><p>For Immediate Release<br/>Tuesday, May 24, 2016</p><h2><i>Ahead of FCC open meeting, call for evaluation of zero-rating plans to be informed by a transparent, open process</i></h2><p>WASHINGTON – Today, 59 companies and grassroots NGOs that <a href="http://www.stayopenfcc.org" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting an open, public process to inform its evaluation of the zero-rating plans offered by Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. </p><p>Signatories to the letter included 38 businesses that support a free and open Internet, including companies such as Pinterest, reddit, Etsy, Vimeo, Automattic, Yelp, CREDO Mobile, Cogent, Level 3, Medium, Mozilla, Union Square Ventures, Vimeo and Kickstarter. 21 civil society groups and coalitions representing diverse constituencies, including Center for Media Justice, 18 Million Rising, Center for Rural Strategies, Engine Advocacy, Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, Daily Kos, and Access Now, also signed on. </p><p>The letter’s signers reference the FCC’s open public process for the net neutrality ruling last year that saw nearly four million individuals make their voices heard. The letter was sent to the FCC before the Commission’s open meeting this Wednesday, May 25.</p><p>The letter states:</p><p>“In the Open Internet Order, the FCC declined to issue a bright-line rule against zero-rating, noting a lack of consensus on the issue in the record. However, in the time since the Order was released, ISPs have created a broad enough set of test cases that a decision on each of them would have much the same effect as a new rule, only without the same public participation and transparency. These decisions are too important to happen behind closed doors.” </p><p>The full letter and list of signatories can be found here: <a href="http://www.stayopenfcc.org/letter.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.stayopenfcc.org/letter.pdf</a></p><p>Said Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng, “If the FCC undercuts its own Open Internet rules by approving zero-rating plans, without even consulting the historic and diverse array of activists, academics, startups, and 3.7 million Internet users who weighed in to make these rules happen, it would be nothing less than appalling. That’s why we’re joining this call for an open process.”</p><p>The Open Internet rules under which the FCC would make these decisions exist thanks to comments from nearly 3.7 million people, hundreds of startups, activists, academics, and advocates.</p><p>Around the world, Tech companies, Internet users, and civil society organizations around the world have been demanding open process around these decisions—and participating in record numbers—most notably in India, where over 500 startups (<a href="http://blog.savetheinternet.in/startups-pm-letter/" target="_blank">http://blog.savetheinternet.in/startups-pm-letter/</a>) and one million people (<a href="http://blog.savetheinternet.in/one-million-submissions/" target="_blank">http://blog.savetheinternet.in/one-million-submissions/</a>) weighed in to ban zero-rating, and in Europe, where a massive consultation on zero-rating and net neutrality rules is set to begin. (<a href="http://savetheinternet.eu/" target="_blank">http://savetheinternet.eu/</a>)</p><p>In the fight for net neutrality in the US, racial justice activists played an especially important role, countering cynical propaganda from cable and telecom companies, and making the case that the Open Internet was essential for media diversity and the ability of communities of color to organize.</p><p><b>The following are statements from letter signers:</b></p><p><i>Brad Burnham, Managing Partner, Union Square Ventures</i></p><p>“Anyone who is paying attention should be very worried about the future of the independent web. The flurry of decentralized, permissionless, innovation that characterized the early web is giving way to a homogenized experience delivered through a small number of dominant gatekeepers. If the FCC allows those dominant platforms to buy favored distribution from wireless carriers, that trend will accelerate. Early stage investors who fueled the innovation on the open web will forced to walk away from even the most creative ideas for fear they will never reach consumers.”</p><p><i>Steven Renderos, Senior Campaign Manager at the Center for Media Justice</i></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much at stake for communities of color to not have our voices included as the Federal Communications Commission considers how to address Zero-Rating data plans.  The threat of a second class Internet experience posed by practices like Zero-Rating is the reason people of color fought so hard to ensure the FCC&rsquo;s Net Neutrality rules applied to wireless as well. The best policymaking happens when communities most directly affected are part of that process, and the FCC can and should consider our voices before making any decisions.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Holmes Wilson, Co-Founder, Fight For The Future</i></p><p>“We didn’t win the historic fight for net neutrality only to allow big telecom companies to tear it down with zero rating schemes. The FCC must hold an open process to consider these dangers to free expression”.</p><p><i>Mark Tseng Putterman, Media Justice Campaigner at 18MillionRising.org</i></p><p>&ldquo;As American consumers and especially as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Big Cable&rsquo;s attack on Net Neutrality through zero-rating programs is an attack on our ability to communicate, access culturally relevant content, and organize online. Zero-rating programs that rely on arbitrary data caps and exempt some content from those caps are particularly harmful for demographics such as young Asian Americans that increasingly rely on data-intensive consumption of streaming video over traditional television. </p><p>An open and equal Internet plays a crucial role in providing outlets for AAPI civic and cultural engagement outside the mainstream avenues from which we are too often excluded. From the independent blogs we get our news from, to the viral AAPI YouTube celebrities who speak to our experiences, to the political power we harness through trending hashtags and online petitions, Net Neutrality provides spaces for us to thrive as consumers, content creators, and change-makers. We urge the FCC to curb the abilities of corporations to shape our habits online and to begin an open, public process to inform its evaluation of zero-rating programs.&rdquo;       </p><p>###</p><p>Contact:</p><p>Steven Renderos, Senior Campaign Manager at the Center for Media Justice, steven@mediajustice.org</p><p>Holmes Wilson, Co-Founder, Fight For The Future, hwilson@gmail.com, (614) 465-6371</p><p>Brad Burnham, Managing Partner, Union Square Ventures, brad@usv.com</p><p>Evan Engstrom, Acting Executive Director, Engine, 415-570-4455 </p>
