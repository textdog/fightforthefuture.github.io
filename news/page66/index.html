        <span class="date">Posted 15:24 EDT on July 11, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://cispai" target="_blank"><strong><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8kb930wQ31ri3xd7.jpg?1506019147622"/></strong></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-6f39d44b-224a-9526-12af-729e38c275e3"><strong><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank">Take action now: Congress is racing toward a vote on CISA, a bill to end privacy.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>The Senate Intelligence Committee just rushed to approve “CISA,” a bill that would give the NSA </span><span>more</span><span> access to our data than ever before, </span><span>and</span><span> give companies like Facebook and Google legal immunity for violating our privacy. [1]<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Does “CISA” sound creepily familiar? <strong>That’s because it’s another zombified version of CISPA, a privacy-killing bill that Internet users have beaten back twice before,</strong> and that has been condemned by public advocacy groups from across the political spectrum as an urgent threat to online privacy and freedom of speech. [2]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank">Your signature is needed right now to stop CISA. Will you click here to take action? Every second counts, the Senate vote could happen quickly without warning &ndash; we need to raise our voices now before it’s too late. </a></strong><br/><span><br/>It’s despicable that the Senate Intelligence Committee, who are supposed to oversee the government’s spying programs and protect our rights, chose this moment to resurrect CISPA and advance it to the Senate floor. The explosive revelations of the past week offered further proof that the U.S. government continues to lie about the scope of its illegal spying operation [3], and revealed the harrowing stories of community leaders who were spied on solely because of their political and religious beliefs. [4]<br/><br/><strong>The Intelligence community is out of control. If we let CISA pass, we&rsquo;d be giving them more power than they&rsquo;ve ever had before. We can&rsquo;t let this happen.<br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to growing outcry against mass surveillance, it should be easier than ever to defeat legislation like CISA. But we can&rsquo;t pull our punches. There are powerful interests lobbying for this type of legislation, and they&rsquo;ve got *way* more money than us. [5] We&rsquo;ve got the public on our side, but it&rsquo;s up to us to mobilize.<br/></span><br/><span><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><strong>Congress is trying to do this quietly, so make noise! Click here to stop CISA now.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Kevin, and Holmes at Fight for the Future<br/></span></strong><span><br/>P.S. We can&rsquo;t stress enough how quickly this bill could move once it hits the Senate floor. It&rsquo;s now or never to get the word out. <strong>Please forward this email to everyone you know</strong> and share the petition on <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffightfortheftr%2Fphotos%2Fa.296919493661517.71630.283481148338685%2F785927948094000%2F%3Ftype%3D1%26theater" target="_blank">Facebook</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=RT+%40fightfortheftr%3A+Congress+is+trying+to+pass+CISPA+again%2C+this+time+it%27s+called+CISA+%26+it%27s+worse+than+the+original&amp;hashtags=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcispaisback.org&amp;related=Fightfortheftr" target="_blank">Twitter.</a></strong></span><strong><span><br/><br/>SOURCES:<br/></span></strong></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:38 EDT on July 11, 2014</span>


        <p><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8jyu08b7P1ri3xd7.jpg?1506019147622"/></p>

<p>Last year, Center for Rights and Fight for the Future helped thousands take action to call for the release of Barrett Brown, a citizen journalist and transparency activist whose trumped up charges set a chilling precedent for freedom of speech.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a link to our petition: <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/barrett-brown/" target="_blank">http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/barrett-brown/</a></strong></p>
<p>Please see below a statement directly from <a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/" target="_blank">FreeBarrettBrown.org</a></p>
<p><strong>&lt;3 Fight for the Future</strong></p>
<p>Today we have a tremendous support statement from <strong><a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/supporters/#pussyriot" target="_blank">Masha Alekhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova</a></strong>, the Russian dissidents known as Pussy Riot. Here&rsquo;s what they had to say about Barrett:</p>
<blockquote>“In Russia, where we live, the rights of journalists carry very little weight and people who aspire for a free press have much envy for the conditions in which media in the West usually functions. But cases that attack whistleblowers, journalists and activists allow Russian propaganda to point to foreign countries and say that “freedom of press” there similarly comes with the prosecution of journalists. Barrett’s case is one that should not be happening in a Western democracy and we hope that American authorities will not continue to set such a horrible example by giving Barrett any more time behind bars.&ldquo;</blockquote>
<p>In addition, <strong><a href="http://voiceproject.org/" target="_blank">The Voice Project</a></strong> and its executive director <strong><a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/supporters/#hunter" target="_blank">Hunter Heaney</a></strong> have signed on to the campaign to free Barrett Brown.<br/><br/> Without having heard from him, we suspect that Barrett is still being held in segregation since a June 17 &quot;semi-disturbance&rdquo; at Seagoville, which <strong><a href="http://frontburner.dmagazine.com/2014/07/01/the-barrett-brown-review-of-arts-and-letters-and-jail-a-visit-to-the-hole/" target="_blank">he wrote about in his last column</a></strong>. Many members of the public have been <strong><a href="http://www.bop.gov/inmates/concerns.jsp" target="_blank">expressing their concerns</a></strong> to the Bureau of Prisons. There&rsquo;s no word yet on when he will be released back to the regular population. Since he didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong and his behavioral record has been otherwise spotless, it&rsquo;s doubtful that he will be charged with an infraction following any disciplinary hearing. It&rsquo;s so hot in the hole that inmates strip to their underwear during the day — this is why the Texas Civil Rights Project is <strong><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/20/justice/texas-prison-heat-lawsuit/" target="_blank">suing over the lack of air-conditioning</a></strong> in Texas state prisons.<br/><br/> If you&rsquo;re attending the HOPE X (Hackers on Planet Earth) conference in NYC <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457146"><span class="aQJ">July 18-20</span></span>, there will be two panels related to Barrett Brown. <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457147"><span class="aQJ">On Friday at noon</span></span>, Brown&rsquo;s attorney Ahmed Ghappour, Anonymous expert Gabriella Coleman, and FreeBB director Kevin Gallagher <strong><a href="http://hope.net/schedule.html#barrettbro" target="_blank">will discuss his case and other matters</a></strong>. Then <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457148"><span class="aQJ">on Saturday at 4PM</span></span>, a group of journalists and researchers will gather to talk about the importance of <strong><a href="http://hope.net/schedule.html#projectpmc" target="_blank">Project PM and crowd-sourced research</a> </strong>of the cyber-intelligence complex, which was founded and pioneered by Barrett.<br/><br/> We hope to see you there, and at Barrett&rsquo;s sentencing, which will occur <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457149"><span class="aQJ">October 6th, 2014 at 1:30 PM CST</span></span> at the federal courthouse on 1100 Commerce St. in Dallas, TX.<br/><br/> If you&rsquo;re wondering what Barrett is still charged with and what he&rsquo;s facing, there&rsquo;s a <strong><a href="http://wiki.project-pm.org/wiki/Barrett_Brown#Current_Case_Disposition_Post_Plea_Agreement" target="_blank">wiki page with a detailed case timeline and the current case disposition</a></strong> (all with references to source documents, as well as an accurate biography and links to important writings). As always, media and press inquiries are welcome.<br/><br/> Thank you for supporting us.<span class="HOEnZb"><br/>Free Barrett Brown<br/></span></p>

<p></p>

<p><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>Urgent action needed: Congress is trying to bring back CISPA &hellip; again.</span></a></p>

<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>

<p><span>Over the weekend a detailed report in the Washington Post caught the U.S. government in more lies about the scope of its dragnet surveillance programs. The Post showed that the NSA intercepted communications from ordinary people 9 times more often than from “targets” suspected of any wrongdoing.</span></p>

<p><span>People are outraged. And we should be. Any politician that plans to keep their job should be doing everything they can to put an end to these illegal and unethical surveillance practices.</span></p>

<p><span>Infuriatingly, *today* the Senate Intelligence Committee is rushing to advance “CISA,” a bill that would give the NSA </span><span>more</span><span> access to our data than ever before, </span><span>and</span><span> give companies like Facebook and Google legal immunity for violating our privacy.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>Your signature is needed to stop CISA, the new CISPA. Will you click here to take action right now? Every second counts, the markup is this afternoon.</span></a></p>

<p><span>Does “CISA” sound kind of familiar? That’s because it’s another zombified version of CISPA, a bill that Internet users have beaten back twice before.</span></p>

<p><span>It’s despicable that the Senate Intelligence Committee, who are supposed to oversee the government’s spying programs and protect our rights, is choosing this moment to resurrect CISPA, and sneaking it through in a closed door markup.</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks to the huge rise in privacy activism and reporting over the past year, it should be easier than ever to defeat legislation like this. But we have to remain vigilant. Congress is trying to do this quietly; we can’t let them. </span><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>Take action right now.</span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-4e68daa7-f355-17c8-af47-273eed625ff2"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>After our last email about how all of you helped &ndash; against great odds &ndash; get critical Amendments passed that limit U.S. government surveillance, many of you wrote to us with one question: </span><em>how did my lawmakers vote?</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://standagainstspying.org/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Report cards are in! Click here to find out how your reps measured up. Did they get an “A” for working to protect our rights? Or an “F” for failing to do their jobs?</a></strong></p>
<p><span>With our friends at EFF and a dozen other organizations, we’ve created a handy scorecard that grades members of U.S. Congress based on what they’ve been doing (or often haven’t been doing) to protect our privacy in the face of out of control government monitoring. </span></p>
<p><strong>Now we know who to blame for the mess that we’re in, and who’s been taking steps to get us out of it.</strong></p>
<p><span>The campaign is called “Stand Against Spying” and it’s gaining support from the left, right and center. We’ve made it easy for U.S. citizens to find out how their representatives voted and contact them to express their opinions.  But this affects everyone, not just those in the U.S., so there’s also a simple tool allowing anyone to sign on to an open letter to the Whitehouse.</span></p>

<p><span>It seems like every day we learn more about the dirty secrets our governments have been keeping about how they spy on us. We need to fight with every tool in the toolbox. We’ll continue to work daily to secure the web through technology, and we’ll hold our leaders to account by demanding they do everything in their power to end the bulk collection of our private phone and internet data.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://standagainstspying.org/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Don’t let Congress get away with ignoring our rights. Click here to find out how lawmakers have been voting, and then do something about it.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Stay tuned for exciting announcements about Reset the Net later this month.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Evan, and Kevin<br/>Fight for the Future</span><br/><br/><strong>P.S.
