<p>Get ready to ditch your same-old lunch-hour routine on Sept. 15 and 16— because we need your help to fight FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s plan to allow discrimination online.</p>
<p>We are organizing protests in NYC, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington, DC to defend net neutrality. We need you there! Can you stop by?</p>
<p><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/nycprotest" target="_blank"><strong>Click here to get info and RSVP for the rally in NYC</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/phillyprotest" target="_blank">Click here to get info and RSVP for the rally in Philadelphia</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://act.freepress.net/survey/sept_16_fcc_action/?t=1&amp;akid=4945.None.TiTiAQ" target="_blank"><strong>Click here to get info and RSVP for the action in Washington, DC</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>BREAKING:</strong> Rally in <strong>Chicago.</strong> Sept 15th. <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_837264987"><span class="aQJ"></span></span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_837264988"><span class="aQJ">Noon-2 PM @ </span></span>Jackson &amp; LaSalle. Heart of the Chicago Financial District. Across the street from the Chicago Federal Reserve. <br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s the details:</p>
<p><strong>Sept. 15</strong> is the <strong><a href="http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_fcc_nprm_oliver/?source=FPblog" target="_blank">deadline for final comments</a> </strong>on Wheeler’s proposal — and while big broadband providers like Comcast are lobbying overtime to push this plan forward, we can’t let them have the last word. To that end we’ve organized big lunchtime rallies in <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/nycprotest" target="_blank"><strong>New York City</strong></a> and <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/phillyprotest" target="_blank"><strong>Philadelphia</strong></a> to save Net Neutrality and fight the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger.</p>
<p><strong>On September 16th</strong>, internet freedom supporters will gather at 11:45am at the FCC building <a href="http://freepress.actionkit.com/mailings/view/4945" target="_blank"><strong>in Washington, DC,</strong></a> and our friends <strong><a href="https://www.netneutrality.com/" target="_blank">from Namecheap</a></strong> will be there with a giant video-billboard playing net neutrality videos on a loop! Want your video projected on the billboard? Email it to team@fightforthefuture.org &ndash; Check out Namecheap&rsquo;s awesome video here to get inspiration: <a href="http://NetNeutrality.com" target="_blank">http://NetNeutrality.com</a> </p>
<p>Your voice is essential right now. If you don’t live in DC, New York or Philly, you can organize a rally in your own community. It’s a pretty easy process and we’ve put together a <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/save-internet-event-guide" target="_blank">handy toolkit</a> </strong>with all the info you need to launch your own event.</p>
<p>All of us on #TeamInternet have made a ton of noise since Wheeler proposed his rules — sending <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/07/16/sorry-ms-jackson-net-neutrality-biggest-thing-ever-fcc" target="_blank">record-breaking numbers of comments</a></strong> to the FCC, rallying in <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/05/15/today-day" target="_blank">Washington, D.C.</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/07/24/net-neutrality-activists-take-over-california" target="_blank">California</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/08/29/net-neutrality-activists-take-senate-storm" target="_blank">meeting with our elected officials</a></strong> to push them to stand up for real Net Neutrality.</p>
<p>But we need to keep speaking out to win this one. We’ve got to keep the momentum moving until Wheeler faces facts and realizes that his proposal would kill the open Internet and please no one except mammoth companies like Comcast that want to squash their competition.</p>
<p>So grab your megaphone and get ready to rally on Sept. 15. Let’s make this national day of action one that Net Neutrality haters will never forget.</p>
<p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:55 EDT on September 11, 2014</span>


        <p id="docs-internal-guid-e154868c-6572-c10a-de9c-0272c11dd978"><em>Day of protest generates nearly 300,000 calls and more than 2 million emails to Congress; 722,364 people filed comments at the FCC.</em></p>
<p><strong>WASHINGTON –</strong><span> On Wednesday, tech companies, websites, public interest organizations and Internet users joined forces to demonstrate overwhelming support for stronger Net Neutrality protections. Participants in the Internet Slowdown added a spinning icon representing a slow-loading Internet to their sites. Millions of people clicked through the icon to a series of actions to members of Congress, the White House and the FCC.</span></p>
<p><strong>An infographic displaying some of the protest highlights is here: <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/#infographic" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/#infographic</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are screenshots from the protest: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fqeiC" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/fqeiC</a></strong></p>
<p>NOTE:<em> The volume of comments overwhelmed the FCC&rsquo;s servers during the slowdown. Fight for the Future is in contact with the FCC&rsquo;s tech team and is working out a solution to ensure that every comment is filed properly.</em></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, Engine Advocacy, and the Free Press Action Fund organized the Internet Slowdown. The Battle for the Net website featuring updates and actions is <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">http://battleforthenet.com</a></span></p>
<p><span>Here are the numbers from the Internet Slowdown:</span></p>
<p><strong>Calls made to Congress: 303,099</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emails sent to Congress: 2,167,092</strong></p>
<p><strong>Comments filed at the FCC: 722,364</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calls per minute to Congress </strong>(during peak hours from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.)<strong>: 1,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Participating websites: more than 10,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook shares of spinning icon: more than 1,120,000</strong></p>
<p><span>These numbers are valid as of 10 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. The final tally on Wednesday&rsquo;s action will be provided at </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">https://www.battleforthenet.com/</a></strong></p>
<p><span>“The numbers tell the story: People everywhere are using the Internet to save the Internet from phone and cable companies,” s<strong>aid </strong></span><strong>Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer</strong><span><strong>.</strong> “We&rsquo;ve shown that the best way to fight these powerful special interests in Washington is through mass action by people from outside Washington. The FCC and Congress can no longer dismiss the overwhelming consensus of public support for real Net Neutrality protections.”</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The Internet Slowdown was the biggest day of online activism since the Internet Blackout of 2012, when people rejected the SOPA and PIPA copyright bills,&rdquo; <strong>said </strong></span><strong>Demand Progress Executive Director David Segal</strong><span><strong>.</strong> &ldquo;As the FCC decision on Net Neutrality approaches, Internet users will continue to speak out in numbers and with a message that will be impossible to ignore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>“Internet users spoke out loud and clear on Wednesday,&ldquo; <strong>said </strong></span><strong>Free Press Action Fund President and CEO Craig Aaron</strong><span><strong>.</strong> “They&rsquo;re united against FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler&rsquo;s plan to allow fast and slow lanes on the Internet. The chairman must now listen to the public, abandon his pay-to-play plan, and pursue the best and only path to real Net Neutrality protections &ndash; by reclassifying Internet service providers as common carriers.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:38 EDT on September 10, 2014</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/><br/>Media contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457 or 617-690-9547</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-ce01f032-606c-0481-9695-3ebd12276686"><strong>‘Internet Slowdown’ launches across the web</strong></p>
<p><em>Businesses and public interest groups hold online action to show support for net neutrality. Companies and websites  cover the web with “loading” icons and call for FCC to protect the open Internet</em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON – Today, tech companies, main street businesses and organizations are demonstrating their support for stronger net neutrality protections by adding a spinning icon to their websites, representing a slow-loading Internet. The symbolic icon links to a series of actions to members of Congress, the White House and the FCC. The event builds on the millions of Americans who have told the government to protect innovation and fairness on the Internet from corporate interference.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The Internet is united against the FCC&rsquo;s Net Neutrality-killing proposal,&rdquo; said Craig Aaron, president and CEO of the Free Press Action Fund. &ldquo;Today we&rsquo;ll see the Internet slow down as millions of people rise up against this threat to our rights to connect and communicate. There aren&rsquo;t many issues that could bring together such a diverse array of groups, big platforms and small businesses, senators and everyday citizens, all of them urging the leaders at the FCC to restore real Net Neutrality.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Internet users had already placed 40,000 phone calls this morning through  </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank"><span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">https://www.battleforthenet.com/</a></span></a></p>
<p><span>(But this represents just a fraction of the total activism, as many major sites have created their own activism tools.)</span></p>
<p><span>Screenshots of some of the participating websites can be found here: </span><a href="https://imgur.com/a/KHnr7" target="_blank"><span><a href="https://imgur.com/a/KHnr7" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/KHnr7</a></span></a></p>
<p><span>Sites are encouraged to continue to join the protests throughout the day &ndash; tools are available at: </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/" target="_blank">www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th</a>.</strong></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s encouraging to see so many prominent companies participating in the day of action in support of an open Internet,” said Evan Engstrom, Policy Director at Engine. “The FCC needs to know that preserving strong net neutrality rules is necessary to ensure that the Internet remains a platform for innovation and economic growth, and that reclassifying broadband as a Title II service is the only way to achieve this goal.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Evan Greer, Campaign Director of Fight for the Future, added. “Today, we are showing once again not only the power of the Internet to defend itself from threats to free speech but the urgency of protecting net neutrality. Today’s protest was organized by a small number of people working very hard with limited resources. Without a neutral net that gives everyone a voice, we would never have gotten this off the ground. The future of every social movement, startup, independent artist, and innovative idea depends on the outcome of this battle for the net.”</span></p>
<p><span>The &ldquo;Internet Slowdown&rdquo; is being organized by Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund and Engine Advocacy. </span><span>The Battle for the Net website with updates and actions is</span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/" target="_blank"><span> </span><span><a href="http://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th" target="_blank">www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th</a></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Groups aim to leave the Internet open so that the next Google and the next Facebook can succeed. They believe that America was built on the fundamental values of freedom of expression where every idea has a fair shot at being heard and big companies like Comcast and Verizon should not be allowed to create Internet fast lanes for rich companies and slow lanes for the rest of the country.</span></p>
<p><span>Political momentum has increased recently, including letters to the FCC supporting the light-touch “Title II” approach to achieving net neutrality from Senator Angus King and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and a statement from Representative Matsui, in addition to previous support from more than a dozen Senators and more than 40 Representatives.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the companies and websites that are participating in the action include Automattic (which runs WordPress.com), </span><span>AVG, Bluehost</span><span> Boing Boing, Cheezburger, Chess.com, Comptel, CREDO Mobile, </span><span>DailyDot</span><span> Digg, Dropbox, Dwolla, Etsy, Fark, Foursquare, Gandi, General Assembly, </span><span>Gfycat</span><span>, </span><span>Grooveshark,</span><span> iFixit, Kickstarter, Meetup, Mozilla, Namecheap, The Nation, Netflix, reddit, SendGrid, </span><span>Tagged, </span><span>Thunderclap, Tumblr, Twilio, Twitter, Upworthy, Urban Dictionary, Vimeo</span><span> , and Wikia</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, Google participated by sending a pro-net neutrality email to its activism list of on order of two million people.</span></p>
<p><span>Participating organizations include, among others, American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause, the Center for Media Justice, ColorOfChange, DailyKos, Demand Progress, Democracy for America, Democrats.com, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Engine Advocacy, Fight for the Future, the Free Press Action Fund, the Future of Music Coalition, Greenpeace USA, the Harry Potter Alliance, the Media Alliance, the Media Mobilizing Project, MoveOn, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, OpenMedia, Popular Resistance, Presente.org, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Progressives United, the Other 98%, RootsAction, Rootstrikers, the Sierra Club, SumOfUs, Voqal, Women, Action &amp; the Media, the Writers Guild of America, East, and the Writers Guild of America, West.</span></p>
