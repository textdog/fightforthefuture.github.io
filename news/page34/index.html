        <span class="date">Posted 20:48 EDT on October 20, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>Apple is the latest major tech company to come out opposing the controversial bill, which would undermine user privacy without improving security</i></h2><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 21, 2015</p><p>Contact: Holmes Wilson, 614-465-6371, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Just days before a critical vote, Apple has become the latest major tech company to voice their opposition to CISA, a so-called cybersecurity bill that experts say would undermine user privacy while utterly failing to improve cybersecurity.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t support the current CISA proposal,&rdquo; Apple <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/10/20/apple-says-its-against-a-key-cybersecurity-bill-days-before-a-crucial-vote/?ooiuoiuer" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> to the Washington Post, &ldquo;The trust of our customers means everything to us and we don&rsquo;t believe security should come at the expense of their privacy.&rdquo;</p><p>“Apple gets privacy and security better than most companies, and way better than Congress does,” said Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng, “Our lawmakers’ lack of understanding of cybersecurity isn’t just embarrassing, it’s dangerous. They should listen to the experts and abandon this hopelessly flawed bill.”</p><p>Apple’s statement is the latest in what can only be described as a revolt by the tech industry who now nearly unanimously oppose the bill. In recent weeks CCIA, which represents Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon, and Sprint <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131222608488/breaking-trade-group-representing-google" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> opposing the legislation, reinforcing individual statements from <a href="https://twitter.com/policy/status/656288688364609536" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/Yelp/status/655938689952976896" target="_blank">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/reddit/status/654714193040400384" target="_blank">reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wikimediapolicy/status/655179547994816512" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p><p>The Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represents Microsoft, Adobe, and others, also clarified that they <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">do not support</a> the bill after Fight for the Future launched <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">YouBetrayedUs.org</a>, a public campaign in response to a letter BSA issued that appeared to support CISA-like legislation.</p><p>For more on Fight for the Future’s campaigns against CISA, <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131582041428/cisa-hits-senate-floor-today-fight-for-the-future" target="_blank">see our press release</a> from earlier today.</p><p>###</p><p>Fight for the Future is a grassroots advocacy group with more than 1.4 million members that fights to protect the Internet as a powerful platform for freedom of expression and social change.

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-20-cisa-hits-senate-floor-today-fight-for-the-future/">CISA hits Senate floor today. Fight for the Future vows to fight, announces plan to launch Internet Defense League action with more than 15,000 websites</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 18:49 EDT on October 20, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>Privacy activists have badly damaged CISA, now seen by many as a sinking ship, while major tech companies including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Wikipedia, Yelp, and reddit also oppose</i></h2><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 20, 2015</p><p>Contact: Holmes Wilson, 614-465-6371, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>After months of delay caused by public outcry and opposition from tech companies, the controversial Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) is finally on the Senate floor.</p><p>In response to the news, digital rights group Fight for the Future announced plans to launch an <a href="http://internetdefenseleague.org" target="_blank">Internet Defense League</a> action, rallying tens of thousands of websites to raise the alarm about the bill, which has been roundly condemned by security experts, privacy advocates, and major tech companies as failing to prevent cyber attacks while opening the door for sweeping new levels of governments surveillance.</p><p>The Internet Defense League (IDL) is a network of more than 15,000 websites who have installed a code that allows them to display an alert message to their users whenever there is an urgent threat or opportunity related to Internet freedom. Founded after the massive protests <a href="http://sopastrike.com" target="_blank">against SOPA</a>, the IDL has opposed previous bills similar to CISA, including the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). The IDL also maintains a list of Twitter users who have opted in to spread the league’s messages, with more than 19,000 people signed up to allow Fight for the Future to tweet urgent action messages on their behalf.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s outrageous that Congress is even considering passing a law that would further erode Internet users&rsquo; privacy and security at a time when both are already so fragile,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, “CISA&rsquo;s supporters have repeatedly claimed that the tech industry needs this legislation, but now nearly every major tech company has come out opposing it, not only because they know it won&rsquo;t stop cyber attacks, but also because it&rsquo;s supremely unpopular with their users. Congress should remember that those users are also voters.&rdquo;</p><p>Fight for the Future and a coalition of other advocacy groups have lead a series of high profile campaigns sparking massive public outrage against the bill. Earlier this year they launched <a href="https://www.faxbigbrother.com/" target="_blank">Operation: #FaxBigBrother</a>, generating more than <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/activists-send-the-senate-6-million-faxes-to-oppose-cyber-bill/" target="_blank">6 million faxes</a> to Senate offices lambasting CISA with the message that “Congress is stuck in 1984.” They also launched a <a href="http://decidethefuture.org" target="_blank">legislative “scoreboard”</a> that grades every member of Congress on their recent surveillance voting record and encourages visitors to contact their lawmakers to oppose CISA. </p><p>The grassroots campaigns have sparked an avalanche of opposition from the tech industry as well. Over the weekend <a href="https://twitter.com/policy/status/656288688364609536" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/Yelp/status/655938689952976896" target="_blank">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/reddit/status/654714193040400384" target="_blank">reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wikimediapolicy/status/655179547994816512" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> weighed in against CISA. Last week, CCIA, an industry association representing tech giants Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon, Sprint, and others, also <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131222608488/breaking-trade-group-representing-google" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> slamming the bill. Mozilla, imgur, Wordpress, Craigslist, Namecheap, and hundreds of other companies have opposed CISA and similar information sharing legislation in the past.</p><p>Last month, the Business Software Alliance, which represents Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies, clarified that <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">it does not support</a> any of the three information sharing bills before Congress after Fight for the Future ran <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">a public campaign</a> called YouBetrayedUs that spurred a flurry of angry emails from consumers targeting companies that signed a BSA letter that appeared to support CISA. The group also initiated a <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org/heroku" target="_blank">boycott of Heroku</a>, the webhosting service owned by Salesforce, which prompted Salesforce’s CEO to <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/129854286868/breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo" target="_blank">take to twitter</a> condemning the BSA letter and saying his company opposes CISA. </p><p>The group continued to make headlines by calling for the <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/130360813438/fight-for-the-future-calls-for-experian-ceo-to" target="_blank">CEO of Experian to resign</a> over his company’s support for CISA after a devastating hack exposed the private data of 15 million T-Mobile customers. Just yesterday, following a viral AP story about Hillary Clinton’s cybersecurity failings as Secretary of State, Fight for the Future <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131494557888/despite-ap-story-detailing-cybersecurity-failures" target="_blank">launched a petition</a> calling for her to state her position on CISA, noting that her opponent Bernie Sanders opposes the bill. </p><p>Fight for the Future and a large coalition of other groups are watching CISA’s progress closely and are preparing for a final showdown on the Senate floor. Senators that expect to maintain their constuents trust would do well to take note of the rising level of opposition to this toxic legislation, which is now only supported by a few self-interested corporations and lawmakers who have a track record of voting to expand and maintain unpopular government surveillance programs.</p><p>###</p><p>Fight for the Future is a grassroots advocacy group with more than 1.4 million members that fights to protect the Internet as a powerful platform for freedom of expression and social change.

        <span class="date">Posted 07:01 EDT on October 20, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 20, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>Twitter is the latest major tech company to join the rising wave of opposition to CISA, a deeply controversial cybersecurity bill that could hit the Senate floor as early as today.<br/></p><p>The company, which has 316 million active users worldwide, <a href="https://twitter.com/policy/status/656288688364609536" target="_blank">tweeted it’s opposition</a> to CISA from it’s official policy account early this morning, saying: “Security + privacy are both priorities for us and therefor we can’t support #CISA as written. We hope to see positive changes going forward.”</p><p>Twitter is joining a growing chorus of major technology companies that have recently come out strongly against the latest version of CISA, echoing concerns from security experts and privacy advocates that CISA would fail to prevent cyber attacks while dramatically expanding government surveillance and undermining user privacy. </p><p>Over the weekend <a href="https://twitter.com/Yelp/status/655938689952976896" target="_blank">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/reddit/status/654714193040400384" target="_blank">reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wikimediapolicy/status/655179547994816512" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> weighed in against CISA.

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-19-despite-ap-story-detailing-cybersecurity-failures/">Despite AP story detailing cybersecurity failures at State Department, Clinton has “no comment” on CISA, a flawed cyber bill that Sanders, tech industry leaders oppose</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:09 EDT on October 19, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 19, 2015</p><p>Contact: Holmes Wilson, 614-465-6371, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>This morning, Fight for the Future <a href="https://www.youbetrayedus.org/hillary/" target="_blank">launched a petition</a> demanding that Hillary Clinton state her position on CISA, a flawed cyber security bill that Clinton competitor Bernie Sanders and tech industry leaders (including Apple, Microsoft, Salesforce, Facebook and Google) have opposed.<br/></p><p>The campaign was launched in the wake of an <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/ap-enterprise-under-clinton-states-cybersecurity-suffered-083957956--politics.html" target="_blank">Associated Press report</a> detailing numerous failures in cybersecurity at the State Department during Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State – failures that go beyond the widely-reported use of insecure email addresses. (This report caused the phrase “under hillary” to trend on social media.)</p><p>“At a time when CISA is being rejected by other politicians, the public, security experts, and even the industry it’s supposed to protect, Clinton&rsquo;s continued silence shows she&rsquo;s in the wrong place on cybersecurity,” said Fight for the Future Co-director Tiffiniy Cheng, “If Clinton wants to reclaim her credibility on this issue, she needs to take a stand against CISA.”</p><p>Both Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul have already come out opposing CISA. Sanders <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/bernie-sanders-cisa-senate-2016-presidential-candidates/" target="_blank">announced his opposition</a> last week.</p><p>“Internet users are outraged that Congress is even considering legislation that undermines the basic security of the Internet by sweeping away privacy protections and letting companies off the hook when they improperly share or leak our personal information,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, “The safety of Internet users’ personal information is more fragile than ever; any candidate for president needs to take this seriously, and line up with the leading voices in tech to oppose the bill.”</p><p>Last week, the trade association CCIA <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/2015/10/ccia-urges-senate-to-improve-cybersecurity-information-sharing-act/" target="_blank">announced its opposition</a> to the bill. CCIA<a href="http://www.ccianet.org/about/members/" target="_blank"> represents</a> a wide range of large technology companies including: Amazon, British Telecom, Cloudflare, Dish, eBay, Facebook, Foursquare, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Pandora, Paypal, Samsung, Sprint, and Yahoo.</p><p>Last month, the Business Software Alliance, which represents Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, Salesforce, and others, clarified that <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">it did not support CISA</a> after Fight for the Future launched a campaign calling attention to the fact that several companies had (apparently mistakenly) <a href="http://www.bsa.org/~/media/Files/Policy/Data/09142015CongLeadershipDataAgendaLetter.pdf" target="_blank">signed a letter</a> that appeared to support CISA-like legislation. </p><p>The <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">YouBetrayedUs.org</a> campaign sparked a major backlash from customers and Internet users, generating thousands of emails to the companies involved, and online calls for a boycott, which quickly lead to Salesforce’s CEO <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/129854286868/breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo" target="_blank">taking to twitter</a> to say that his company does not support the bill and the original BSA letter was “a mistake.”</p><p>Technology companies and members of Congress are under increasing pressure to oppose CISA, which has now been delayed multiple times in the Senate after grassroots uprisings. Fight for the Future and other groups are planning to escalate their efforts targeting members of Congress, presidential candidates and technology companies that remain silent or support CISA, and will be ready if the bill comes before the Senate in the coming weeks.</p><p>###</p>
