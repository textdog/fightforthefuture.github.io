Other participants include Amazon, Reddit, Netflix, OK Cupid, Mozilla, Etsy, Kickstarter, Vimeo, and PornHub</i></h2><p></p><p>Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Twilio, Plays.tv, and Adblock are among latest major web platforms to join the Internet-Wide <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank"><b>Day of Action</b></a> to Save Net Neutrality scheduled for July 12th to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal framework for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation. Companies participating will display prominent messages on their homepages on July 12 or encourage users to take action in other ways, like through push notifications and emails.</p><p>The momentum comes against the backdrop of a recent Morning Consult / POLITICO poll <b><a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/21/poll-shows-broad-bipartisan-support-net-neutrality-rules/" target="_blank">that shows</a> </b>broad bipartisan support for net neutrality rules. “This protest is gaining so much momentum because no one wants their cable company to charge them extra fees or have the power to control what they can see and do on the Internet,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“Congress and the FCC need to listen to the public, not just lobbyists. The goal of this day of action is to make them listen.”</p><p>More than 40,000 people, sites, and organizations have signed up to participate in the effort overall, and more announcements from major companies are expected in the coming days. Many popular online personalities including YouTuber <a href="https://twitter.com/PhillyD/status/872200755020578816" target="_blank">Philip DeFranco</a>, and dozens of major online forums and subreddits have also announced their participation.</p><p><b>See the announcement for the day of action here: <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/july12</a>  </b></p><p>The effort is led by many of the grassroots groups behind the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the Internet Slowdown. The day of action will focus on grassroots mobilization, with public interest groups activating their members and major web platforms providing their visitors with tools to contact Congress and the FCC.</p><p>Companies participating include Amazon, Netflix, OK Cupid, Kickstarter, Etsy, Reddit, Mozilla, Vimeo, Y Combinator, GitHub, Private Internet Access, Pantheon, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Patreon, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile, Goldenfrog, Fark, Chess.com, Imgur, Namecheap, DuckDuckGo, Checkout.com, Sonic, Brave, Ting, ProtonMail, O’Reilly Media, Discourse, and Union Square Ventures. Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, EFF,  Internet Association,  Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, Rock the Vote, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, MoveOn, Internet Creators Guild, and many others. <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank">See the full list here.</a></p><p><b>Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said:</b> “The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and we’re not going to let the FCC take that power away from us. Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn that net neutrality is not a partisan issue and Internet users will not tolerate these attacks on our basic rights &ndash; we will come together to protect the web as an open platform for free expression and exchange of ideas.” </p><p><b>Michal Rosenn, General Counsel at Kickstarter, said: </b>“A threat to net neutrality is a threat to the free exchange of ideas that creative culture and an informed public rely upon. Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.” </p><p><b>Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: </b>&ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”</p><p><b>Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said: </b>“Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”</p><p><b>Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said:</b> “The FCC&rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.” </p><p><b>Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said:</b> &quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&rdquo;<br/></p><p><b>Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said:</b> “It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.”</p><p><b>Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said: </b>&ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said: </b>&ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&rsquo;d put both us and our customers&rsquo; innovation at risk.&quot; </p><p>###</p>
