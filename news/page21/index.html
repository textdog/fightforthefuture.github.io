      <h1><a href="/news/2016-06-23-telecom-industry-poised-to-win-big-with-eu-net/">Telecom industry poised to win big with EU ‘net neutrality’ rules that let them prioritize services of their choosing and throttle VPN and torrent traffic.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:34 EDT on June 23, 2016</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="250" data-orig-width="300"><img data-orig-height="250" data-orig-width="300" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_o9aqb2soAq1u3ugzc_500.gif"/></figure><p>After being besieged by telecom lobbyists, the European Union’s 
communications regulatory body, BEREC, has issued “net neutrality” 
guidelines that let ISPs prioritize certain services and throttle whole 
classes of traffic, like VPNs, BitTorrent, or videochat. The proposal is
 in a final public comment period that ends on July 18.</p><p>Under the 
proposal, ISPs are instructed to discriminate against classes of traffic
 when managing their networks. The rules appear to be designed to 
prevent commercial considerations when deciding what to throttle—and 
that’s a good thing—but the wording of the regulation could lead to 
forms of discrimination that are even more far reaching. For example, 
peer-to-peer traffic could be throttled before traffic from streaming 
video services, even if the peer-to-peer service is in fact using less 
bandwidth. VPN traffic could be throttled simply because ISPs wouldn’t 
be able to determine what category it is.</p><p>And this mass throttling
 could be done as a standard operating procedure, not just for times 
when there is excessive congestion on a network. Under the rules, ISPs 
can engage in class-based throttling whenever they believe congestion is
 “impending,” which, if you consider the chaotic nature of the Internet,
 could really be whenever.</p><p>Another major loophole in the rules is 
the ability for ISPs to engage in zero rating, a practice that has been 
around in Europe for a while and is a big part of why online innovation 
has been sluggish there. Under zero rating, ISPs exempt their own apps 
and services, and those of their partners, from monthly data caps. These
 arrangements incentivize ISPs to reduce data allowances (EU ISPs that 
engage in zero rating give, on average,<a href="http://dfmonitor.eu/" target="_blank"> 50% less data</a> each month for the same price) and they give ISPs more control over what we do online.   </p><p>These
 loopholes allow ISPs to violate net neutrality’s basic principles, and 
they will ensure that Europe’s Internet continues to lag behind the rest
 of the developed world. Innovation will stall under the uncertainties 
created by these provisions, and freedom of expression will be limited 
as ISPs cement their gatekeeper status on the Internet in the EU. Europe
 is the world’s largest economy. What happens to the Internet in Europe 
profoundly affects Internet freedom around the world.</p><p><b>It doesn’t have to be this way.</b></p><p>So
 far, lobbyists for ISPs have been the dominant voices in shaping these 
rules. Europe’s biggest telecom companies, like Deutsche Telekom, 
Orange, and Vodafone, lobbied hard to get the EU Parliament to punt many
 of the most important decisions to BEREC, an unaccountable regulatory 
bureaucracy. The loophole-filled guidelines that BEREC released make it 
clear that the lobbyists were successful. They got more out of BEREC 
than they ever would have been able to get if these decisions were made 
in the original legislation. </p><p>Now it’s our turn. BEREC has opened a
 comment period to hear from the public before they give their final 
approval. This comment period only stays open for a matter of weeks, so 
if you want your voice heard you need to act quick. You do not have to 
live in the European Union to take action.</p><p>This is our chance to 
let them know we want strong net neutrality rules. If enough of us speak
 up, we can beat the lobbyists and get these loopholes fixed. It’s how 
real net neutrality was won in the United States, and it’s how India 
defeated Facebook’s offensive “Free Basics” zero-rating scheme and 
passed net neutrality rules instead. We can do the same in Europe, but 
we have to act now.</p><p><b><a href="http://www.savenetneutrality.eu/" target="_blank">We’ve made it super simple to submit a comment to BEREC in support of net neutrality.

        <span class="date">Posted 18:30 EDT on June 22, 2016</span>


        <p>This morning the Senate fell one vote short of attaching a rider to a spending bill that would give the FBI sweeping new surveillance authority, including warrantless access to browsing history. Now, Senate leaders are trying to turn just one more senator in favor of the rider before doing a re-vote. This process is being spearheaded by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who introduced the rider (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/20/senate-section/article/S4335-2" target="_blank">McCain Amendment 4787</a>) late on Monday and is trying to sneak it through using a cloture process that limits any debate.</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:02 EDT on June 21, 2016</span>


        <p>June 21, 2016</p><p>Every County Court in America is about to have the power to issue warrants that would give the FBI the ability to hack anyone in the world, millions at a time. The new rule would be so broad that if you have malware or are using certain privacy software, you could be targeted by the FBI. This authority is brand new — until this rule goes into effect, courts have only been able to issue warrants for the areas they serve.<b><br/></b></p><p><b><a href="https://noglobalwarrants.org/" target="_blank">You can help stop the expansion of government hacking now - email your rep and tell them to reject the changes to Rule 41 by passing the Stop Mass Hacking Act</a> </b>[1]</p><p>Fight for the Future is joining over 45 organizations concerned about digital security in a day of action today, June 21, to speak out against this change to Rule 41. (<a href="https://noglobalwarrants.org/assets/Rule41CoalitionLetter.pdf" target="_blank">Read the coalition letter here</a>)</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the deal: The Department of Justice is using an amendment to a procedure, Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to sneak through a whole new policy without Congressional action, and it would represent a sweeping expansion of law enforcement’s ability to engage in hacking and surveillance. If Congress does nothing, this massive change will automatically go into effect on December 1. </p><p><b><a href="https://noglobalwarrants.org/" target="_blank">We need to stop this amendment from going into effect, but we can’t do it alone</a>.</b></p><p>The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are supposed to set the rules for day-to-day procedural details involved with federal criminal prosecution, and are definitely not supposed to change substantive rights. But the modification to Rule 41 isn’t procedural at all. It would grant a judge the ability to issue a warrant to remotely access, search, seize, or copy data when “the district where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological means” like VPNs, or whenever the computer appears to be involved in a botnet.This could turn the millions of unknowing victims of such malware into targets of government hacking themselves. The modified rule would grant this broad authority to any judge in any district where activities related to the crime may have occurred. It creates new avenues for government hacking that were never approved by Congress.

        <span class="date">Posted 11:17 EDT on June 20, 2016</span>


        <h2>Fight for the Future and other pro-net neutrality groups plan June 28th online protest—recruit websites to participate in mass day of action to fuel awareness and drive public comments to EU telecom regulators.</h2><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org<br/></p><p>On June 28th, 2016, websites from across the globe will participate in “The EU Slowdown,” an online protest showing people what the Internet would be like if Europe fails to protect net neutrality. Websites will display a spinning “loading” icon based on Europe’s flag and provide visitors with tools for easily submitting pro-net neutrality comments to BEREC, the European Union regulatory body currently deciding on the issue.</p><p>The day of action is being organized by Fight for the Future, the group that built the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Battle for the Net</a> and <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> actions that helped to win net neutrality in the United States. The group has launched <a href="http://www.savenetneutrality.eu" target="_blank">www.savenetneutrality.eu</a> and is currently organizing websites to participate in the action. Mozilla, makers of popular web browser Firefox, has already begun encouraging its European users to file comments, at <a href="https://savetheinternet.eu/" target="_blank">savetheinternet.eu</a>.</p><p>In 2014, when Fight for the Future ran a similar campaign around US net neutrality negotiations, over 40,000 websites participated and more than 2 million people took action, setting a record for the number of comments received by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) in a single day. Those comments were cited as influential in the the FCC’s decision to support strong net neutrality rules. </p><p>“Europe is the world’s largest economy,” said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-director at Fight for the Future. “If we let Europe’s cable and telecom companies undermine the Internet with loopholes in the net neutrality regulations, it would be a huge hit for innovation and freedom of expression globally. We need strong net neutrality rules in Europe if the global Internet is to fulfill its promise and bring democracy and opportunity to the masses.”</p><p>The Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications (BEREC) is currently holding a public consultation period on their proposed rules for net neutrality that ends on July 18, 2016. Fight for the Future and other open Internet advocates, startups, investors, and academics, believe that BEREC’s proposed rules are not strong enough to actually protect net neutrality, and they are urging them to fix to fix several loopholes before they issue the final ruling. </p><p>Specifically, they are concerned that the rules allow Internet service providers to prioritize their own content, or their partners’ content, through “zero rating” certain content against subscribers’ monthly data caps. They are also concerned about ISPs ability under the rules to throttle entire classes of Internet traffic—things like bittorrent, video chat, or VPNs—under loopholes in the “network management” provisions. </p><p>“For too long, Europeans have been stuck with inferior Internet access because ISPs have been allowed to create fast lanes and slow lanes,” said Holmes Wilson, co-director at Fight for the Future. “BEREC has an opportunity to bring Europe’s Internet up to speed with the rest of the developed world, but if they fail to close these loopholes they will continue to lag behind, and Internet users in Europe will be cut off from the social and economic benefits that only a free and open Internet can provide.”</p><p>To participate in the June 28th Internet Slowdown, people who own websites, blogs, or Tumblr accounts can easily host a “slow loading” widget by embedding a line of code provided by Fight for the Future. The widget will pop up and greet everyone who visits sites that use the code, drawing attention to the issue and making it simple for them submit comments to BEREC urging the to close the loopholes and enact strong rules to protect the Internet in Europe. </p>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:15 EDT on June 15, 2016</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<b><br/></b></p><p>June 15, 2016</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>July 23 event in Denver will launch multi-city roadshow featuring high profile performers and speakers to defeat dangerous, anti-democratic deal</i></h2><p></p><p>DENVER, CO––Legendary guitarist <b>Tom Morello</b> (Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave), popular punk band <b>Anti-Flag</b>, Golden Globe nominated actress <b>Evangeline Lilly</b> (Lost, The Hobbit, Ant-Man), Denver-based hip-hop outfit <b>Flobots</b>, and buzzworthy bi-lingual rockers <b>Downtown Boys </b>will perform at a free concert in Denver at Summit Music Hall on Saturday, July 23rd to mobilize opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. The event will kick off the Rock Against the TPP roadshow. Organized by Morello’s new label, <b>Firebrand Records</b> and digital rights group <b>Fight for the Future</b>, the roadshow features a nationwide series of activism-fueled music events designed to raise awareness about the dangers of the TPP and build opposition to the toxic deal that was negotiated in secret with hundreds of corporate advisors. The TPP has little to do with trade, but would provide multinational corporations with new rights and powers that threaten good paying jobs, Internet freedom, the environment, access to medicine, and food safety.</p><p><b>See a full lineup and Rock Against the TPP tour dates here: <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank">RockAgainstTheTPP.org</a></b> </p><p>Additional Rock Against the TPP tour dates and line-ups in other cities will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>“Working people everywhere have had enough,” <b>said Tom Morello,</b> “The TPP is nothing short of a corporate takeover of our democracy. That’s why people are rising up to stop it. Corporate lobbyists want to sneak the TPP through Congress quietly; that means it’s time for us to get loud.”</p><p>“This fight against the TPP is not about right and left, it’s about right and wrong,” <b>said Evangeline Lilly, </b>“Whatever you’re passionate about, whether it’s human rights, internet freedom, climate change, or food safety, the TPP is a bad deal for humanity, and a threat to the future of democracy. The more people learn about the TPP, the less they like it. It’s our responsibility to sound the alarm, before it’s too late.”</p><p>The <a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org" target="_blank"><b>Rock Against the TPP</b></a> Tour is being organized by <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><b>Fight for the Future</b></a>, the viral Internet freedom group best known for organizing the largest online protests in history against online censorship and in favor of free speech and privacy. <a href="http://firebrandrecords.com/" target="_blank"><b>Firebrand Records</b></a>, the new social justice infused record label co-founded by Tom Morello and Ryan Harvey, is acting as the tour’s artistic partner. The roadshow is sponsored and co-organized by a diverse coalition of groups fighting against the corporate power grab that is the TPP, including Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America, CREDO, Demand Progress, the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, the Sierra Club, and the Teamsters.</p><p>Additional performers for the Denver kick-off include Firebrand Records artists <a href="http://ryanharveymusic.com" target="_blank"><b>Ryan Harvey</b></a>, <a href="http://www.liarose.com/" target="_blank"><b>Lia Rose</b></a>, and <a href="http://sonofnun.net/" target="_blank"><b>Son of Nun</b></a>, Puerto Rican vocalist <a href="http://tainaasili.com" target="_blank"><b>Taina Asili</b></a>, and riot-folk singer / Fight for the Future campaign director <a href="http://evangreer.org" target="_blank"><b>Evan Greer</b></a>, the tour’s lead organizer. Speakers from a broad coalition of organizations opposing the TPP will address the crowd, explaining the many dangers posed by the agreement.</p><p>“The TPP is not a trade deal, it’s a corporate coup––an attack on the future of democracy and free speech,” <b>said Evan Greer,</b> “people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly oppose it, and we’re going to fight not only to stop the TPP, but to make sure that decisions that affect all of us are never made behind closed doors in the future.”</p><p>###<br/><br/></p><p><b>About Tom Morello:</b> Incendiary rock guitarist and acoustic troubadour Tom Morello, known for his innovative guitar solos and thunderous chords, is a groundbreaking artist whether in his solo career or as an original member of the rock bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, two acts responsible for multiple Grammy Awards and a combined 30 million albums sold worldwide. He’s released four solo albums as The Nightwatchman and formed the band Street Sweeper Social Club with Boots Riley of The Coup in 2009. Morello has also been recognized by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the “100 Greatest Guitar Players of All-Time (#26).” Morello has produced or collaborated with artists of diverse genres including WuTang Clan, Johnny Cash, Tool, John Fogerty, Anti-Flag, Public Enemy, Joe Strummer, Crystal Method, Calle 13, Dave Mathews Band, Johnny Cash, Linkin Park, Travis Barker and Pete Seeger. In addition, he joined Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band for their 2014 world tour in support of Springsteen’s studio album High Hopes (Columbia Records) on which Morello is featured on eight tracks.  Most recently, Morello has joined forces with fellow Rage Against The Machine bandmates Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk, as well as Cypress Hill’s B-Real and Public Enemy’s Chuck D and DJ Lord to form the band Prophets of Rage. The group came together as a politically charged response to 2016’s tumultuous election year and after three sold-out club shows announced the launch of a 35-city trek across North America this summer.</p><p><b>About Evangeline Lilly:</b> Evangeline Lilly is an actress best known for her role as Kate Austen in LOST and films including The Hurt Locker, Real Steel, The Hobbit and Ant-Man.

Flobots are internationally known for their 2008 platinum single “Handlebars” and widely recognized for using their music as an inspiration for social change.</p><p><b>About Downtown Boys: </b>Downtown Boys are a bilingual political sax punk party from Providence, Rhode Island in the northeast United States. Rolling Stone called them &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Most Exciting Punk Band&rdquo; and NME has declared them a Band to Watch in 2016. They write songs about smashing the prison-industrial complex, racism, queerphobia, capitalism, fascism, boredom, and all things people tell us that try to close our minds, eyes, and hearts. The band is known for their live performances, which are equal parts punk show, political rally, and religious revival. Frontwoman Victoria Ruiz delivers moving speeches between songs, working the crowd into an angry but hopeful frenzy. The songs themselves are delivered with an earnestness, fun, and intensity that&rsquo;s stunned audiences on their tours throughout North America. </p><p><b>About Fight for the Future: </b>Fight for the Future is a non-profit with more than 1 million members dedicated to defending and expanding the Internet’s transformative power for good. They’re best known for their vibrant, viral campaigns, and for organizing the largest online protests in history against SOPA, for net neutrality, and against mass surveillance. Last year, the group drove tens of thousands of phone calls and emails to Congress opposing the TPP through its <a href="http://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">StopFastTrack.com</a> coalition page. They also made headlines for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDKzwB8GhN0" target="_blank">flying a 30 foot blimp</a> opposing the TPP over Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings in Oregon. Fight for the Future conceived of the Rock Against the TPP effort, and are leading the organizing of the tour, with support from a wide range of public interest groups, labor unions, and grassroots volunteers.</p><p><b>About Firebrand Records:</b> Firebrand is a bold new project from Ryan Harvey (Riot-Folk) and Tom Morello (Rage Against The Machine, Audioslave, Prophets of Rage) dedicated to the global release and distribution of radical, socially conscious music. In recent years, people around the world have surprised each other with their courage, strength, and willingness to stand against injustice, militarism, and corruption. And where there has been protest, there has been music. Born from these times, Firebrand gives a platform for such voices. We know that music alone does not change the world, but we recognize that it is an integral part of the movements that do.</p>
