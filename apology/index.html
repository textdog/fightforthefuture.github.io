          at Fight for the Future, a project of Center for Rights, which in turn
          is a 501(c)4 nonprofit with a 501(c)3 application in the works.
          Tiffiniy and Holmes are the founders. Joshua is our developer.
          We&#8217;re a new organization, but we&#8217;re well-known for our
          efforts to stop SOPA &amp; PIPA, the infamous website-blocking
          legislation.

        </p>

        <p>
          Back in January we decided to move to a new service
          (<a href="http://actionkit.com">Action Kit</a>) for sending emails.
          During that process, we asked our former provider
          (<a href="http://bluestatedigital.com">Blue State Digital</a>) for an
          export of subscribed users only. Instead, <b>they gave us an export
          that included all users, and as a result, our last mailing went to
          every one of the 84,000 people who had unsubscribed from our
          list.</b> This makes us feel sick. To everyone that happened to,
          we&#x27;re so sorry. It will never happen again.

        </p>

        <p>
          The same mistake also destroyed our reputation with the anti-spam
          community. In February, Spamhaus contacted us to say that harvested
          emails were getting on our list, and we worked with them to a
          resolution: unsubscribing all 33,000 emails from the petition that
          seemed to be the problem. After we dumped these emails, Spamhaus gave
          us the go ahead to continue using our list. We thought we were in the
          clear. But, the migration error not only made it so we emailed
          everyone who unsubscribed, but also put all 33,000 emails that we
          threw away back onto our list, which from Spamhaus&#8217;s view looked
          like us trashing our agreement. Worse, coming from a new server at our
          new provider, it looked to Spamhaus and anyone else on the anti-spam
          frontlines that we were switching IPs to avoid their blocks (or even
          worse, that we&#8217;d been kicked off Blue State Digital).

        </p>

        <p>
          <b>So to Spamhaus
            (<a href=”http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/query/SBL135417”>their
              listing</a>) the Mailsleaze blog
            (<a href=”http://mainsleaze.spambouncer.org/?p=1793”>their post</a>),
            and everyone who works on fighting spam: we&#8217;re equally sorry,
            and we&#8217;re ready to do whatever it takes to rebuild your
            trust.</b> As a first step, we&#8217;re going to give you a detailed
          account so you can see what&#8217;s happened, and a list of things
          we&#8217;re doing right now to fix it. We&#8217;ve shown this document
          to Action Kit and BSD so that they could verify its accuracy, and all
          emails are included here with permission. These are the areas we think
          are important (we&#8217;ve included dates, as well as key emails):

          Finally, Fight for the Future is new on the scene, but its founders
          aren&#x27;t. We&#x27;ve built ethically-founded free software projects
          that people love (<a href="http://getmiro.com">Miro</a>,
          <a href="http://universalsubtitles.org">Amara</a>,
          <a href="http://opencongress.org">OpenCongress</a>) and we&#x27;ve
          worked for and alongside some of the internet&rsquo;s most trusted
          organizations (Holmes was a campaign manager at the
          <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>, Joshua comes
          from <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a> and together
          we&rsquo;ve worked closely with
          <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>,
          <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home"> Wikimedia</a>, the
          <a href="http://eff.org">EFF</a>, and
          <a href="http://publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a>). We have
          no conceivable interest in harvesting emails or emailing unsubscribed
          users. Even if we did, we never would. The anti-spam fight is about
          giving individual users control of the internet. That&#x27;s what
          we&#x27;re fighting for too. We&#x27;re committed to building
          something lasting, fighting for issues that many of you support. I
          hope we&#x27;re worthy of your understanding, forgiveness, and most of
          all your help in finding fixes that let us continue our work.

        </p>

        <p>
          During the fight to stop SOPA, our ability to send emails to a large
          list was crucial. We used our growing list of supporters to drive
          phone calls to the House and Senate at crucial moments and
          <a href="http://my.americancensorship.org/">organized in-person
            meetings with Senators in 30 states.</a> Without that sustained
          activity, organized using email, the two
          <a href="http://americancensorship.org">spectacular</a>
          <a href="http://sopastrike.com">protests</a> would have seemed much
          less substantial to Congress. If SOPA or similar legislation returns,
          email will let us notify the millions of people who took action,
          starting right where we left off.

        </p>

        <p>
          We still don&#8217;t know how harvested emails ended up on our list,
          but we know we need to take aggressive steps to prevent it.
          We&#8217;ve already had a hint of underhanded attacks: on Nov 22, 2012
          our domain registrar Dreamhost pulled the plug on all our domains in
          response to an unverified complaint, days after the first SOPA
          protest. <a href="http://publicknowledge.org/">Public
          Knowledge&#x27;s</a> site was
          <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/blog/about-last-weeks-malware-attack">hacked
            the same week</a> when somebody inserted malicious code on their
          page, causing their site to be blocked by
          <a href="http://stopbadware.org/">StopBadware.org.</a> If anyone with
          a botnet can shut down our ability to reach supporters by
          contaminating our list with trap addresses, that could sink us, so
          we&rsquo;re going to start using a confirmed opt-in process to ensure
          that new addresses we collect are from real people who want emails
          from us.


        </p>

          If you can help, if you have any thoughts, or if you think
          there&#x27;s anything missing, please let us know:

        <p>
          Our list grew at moments when several sites with huge traffic (and
          many more small and mid-sized sites) were sending people to our pages
          with prominent links or embedded &#8220;write congress&#8221; forms.
          All of our forms include a clear statement that we will contact people
          about future campaigns. The vast majority also block multiple
          submissions from the same IP. Until Spamhaus told us on Feb 10 that we
          were hitting their spamtrap addresses, we had no reason to doubt the
          integrity of our list.

            had left their links in place for days after Jan 18, so the list
            continued to grow.

          Timeline: Spamhaus Issue</a></h2>

        <p>
          On February 10 Spamhaus told our CRM provider Blue State Digital
          that our list was dirty, that we were hitting Spamhaus traps. They
          told us that the trap addresses we were hitting belonged to pages on
          listed on <a href="http://sopastrike.com">sopastrike.com</a>. They
          also told us (via BSD) that they had confirmed cases of failures to
          unsubscribe. We didn&#8217;t know how trap addresses got on our list,
          but we agreed with BSD and Spamhaus on removing all emails from one
          sopastrike.com petition as a first step. Our understanding was that,
          if this didn&#8217;t solve the problem, we would remove a larger set
          of emails. BSD fixed a bug in their unsubscribe page, and Spamhaus
          gave us the okay to send more emails. By that point we were already in
          the process of migrating to Actionkit, so we didn&#8217;t send any
          more emails to the full list until April 6th. (Two other emails in
          late March went to tiny parts of the list).

              <p>
                Hi Holmes, Josh and Tiffiny,

              </p>

              <p>
                It seems like we are running into some problems with your
                recent email blasts that are being sent to your entire list. The
                mailing that was sent yesterday forced one of our production
                mail serves on to Spamhaus&#x27;s spam block list. This is
                happening because your email list is extremely dirty. Please
                take a look at our email upload policy as a reminder
                (http://tools.bluestatedigital.com/kb/nuts-and-bolts-entry/wp-email-list-upload-policy).
                You should also be aware that this status can threaten the
                hosting of your full site, because repeated tagging as spam from
                your domain might threaten your site.

              </p>

              <p>
                Until the list can be cleaned up, we are will be routing all of
                your mailings through our QOS mailer, which is isolated from our
                production mailers. This will probably hurt your delivery rates
                slightly. We would be more than happy to discuss this with you
                over the phone and to try and figure out why your email blasts
                are being flagged.

              </p>

              <p>
                Thanks,

          <dd>We get on the phone with BSD immediately. They say that Spamhaus
            told them emails were scraped from the pages of sites that
            participated in the SOPA blackout (pages listed at sopastrike.com).
            They also say that a single email address keeps getting mailed. We
            sent BSD and Spamhaus links to all of our forms, and we sent BSD
            data to help them track down the single failed unsubscribe issue.

          <dt>c. Feb 10, 2012 - afternoon</dt>
          <dd>On our second call with BSD and BSD&#x27;s sysadmin (BSD&#8217;s
            main contact to Spamhaus), we discuss different steps to resolve the
            problem, and decide to remove all emails from the
            http://sopastrike.com/ &#8216;request a site to protest&#8217;
            petition. BSD and Spamhaus agree that, even though we don&#8217;t
            know the source of the problem, we know it&#8217;s linked to
            the &ldquo;request a site&rdquo; petition on the sopastrike.com
            front page, and therefore that removing these emails makes sense as
            a first step. We clarify the step we&#8217;ve decided on for BSD:

            good to send emails again. At this point, we (right or wrong)
            considered the Spamhaus issue resolved until we knew otheriwse. From

              Hi everybody -
            </p>

              <p>
                The data we got from your unsubscribe table has proved very
                helpful. As you know, we&#x27;re putting together a workaround
                for the GMail &#x27;.&#x27; issue. From the other addresses that
                reported unsubscribe failures, we think we&#x27;ve been led to
                the root cause of the failure that Spamhaus reports. We&#x27;ll
                keep you posted on that progress.
              </p></div>
            (BSD later gave us more information on what the unsubscribe problem
            was, in an email on April 11)
            <div class="email"><p>
              &quot;Here&#x27;s the note we sent to spamhaus
              about it: &quot;Just sending the final results on the failed
              unsubscribe (opt out) issue.
            </p>

              <p>
                We made a change in March of last year that resulted in us
                suppressing and ignoring certain internal framework errors
                relating to the unsubscribe process. This sometimes resulted in
                us marking email addresses in client databases as successfully
                processed and unsubscribed when they had not been.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have reverted the change so that if there is an error during
                the unsubscribe process, an alert is generated and those rows
                will be retried the next time the unsubscribe process is
                run.

          Timeline: Migration Disaster</a></h2>

        <p>
          In September 2011, after considering both Blue State Digital and
          Action Kit, we decided on BSD. But in November we started to have
          serious issues and began discussing migration to Action Kit, making
          the final decision to move in January. When we asked for an export of
          &#8220;subscribed users&#8221;, BSD gave us a table that included <i>all
          users with no information on unsubscribes or bounces.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          This mean that our next mailing--months later--went to every user who
          had ever been on our list, breaking our promise to Spamhaus and any
          user who had asked to be unsubscribed. In retrospect we should have
          verified that the data was what we asked for. But there&#8217;s no
          conceivable misunderstanding; an export that included all users and no
          unsubscribe data was, essentially, a timebomb. Action Kit didn&#8217;t
          mess up: we told them that the data was what we believed it to be. BSD
          has apologized to us, and can verify that the mistake was theirs.

                I think what in part we are dealing with here is an issue of
                timing. Our backup database dump we sent you guys was seemingly
                assembled before the initial Spamhaus issue. You are correct
                though, in reviewing what happened, we did send constituents
                that had been marked as unsubbed.
              </p>

              <p>
                This was a mistake on our side and I do apologize for that.
              </p>

              <p>
                Ideally we would have sent you a refreshed full file at the end
                of the engagement. I am sorry that this aspect has caused you so
                much grief. If you are in communication with Spamhaus about this
                issue, feel free to include us in this chain so we can verify
                this.

          Steps we&#x27;re taking immediately</a></h2>

        <p>
          Now that we know what happened with the migration error, there are
          some obvious steps we&#8217;re taking.

        </p>
        <ul class="alpha">
          <li>Re-remove all unsubscribed users from our list (DONE)</li>
          <li>Re-remove all bounces from our list (DONE)</li>
          <li>Re-remove all 33.9k addresses from sopastrike.com/ from list as
            per agreement with Spamhaus. (DONE)
          </li>
          <li>Remove an even larger number of email addresses that came from
            sopastrike.com/, up to 75,000.
          </li>
          <li>In any future migration, verify with multiple tests that all
            unsubscribe requests are preserved (DOCUMENTED)
          </li>
          <li>Remove any addresses entered on forms that didn&#x27;t block
            multiple submissions from the same IP (our call congress widget and
            a censor your site tool).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Finally, given this huge screw up in honoring unsubscribes, we&#8217;d
          like to be even more careful in the future about spotting and
          resolving failed unsubscribes. We can&#8217;t make any specific
          commitment to timing, but we will also be adding an issue tracking
          system to make sure that any reported instance of a failed unsubscribe
          stays on our radar until it&#8217;s diagnosed and fixed.

      <section><h2>
        <a href="#steps-were-considering" id="steps-were-considering">5. Steps
          we&#x27;re considering</a></h2>

        <p>
          The hard part: we know we&#8217;re on our last chance with Spamhaus
          and others, and we still don&#8217;t know the cause of the problem. If
          we take the above steps and keep hitting spamtraps, we&#8217;re
          screwed. If the above steps work, but somebody with a botnet later
          submits known harvested emails to our list, we&#8217;re screwed. So
          before we start sending emails again, we need a better plan. If you
          have expertise in this space and you have any ideas, please be in
          touch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re considering for future signup forms to
          keep out fake submissions while keeping it easy to, say, contact
          Congress:
        </p>
        <ul class="alpha">
          <li>Use Facebook, Google, OpenID API for signups.</li>
          <li>CAPTCHA for anyone entering email</li>
          <li>Confirmed opt-in for anyone entering email</li>
          <li>Mutliple chances to confirm opt-in</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: -80px;">Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re
          considering for existing users, to weed out any addresses that shouldn&#8217;t
          be there:

        </p>
        <ul class="alpha">
          <li>Go through our data looking for patterns consistent with single
            users or botnets
          </li>
          <li>Confirmed opt-in for all users who haven&#x27;t visited our pages
            from a link in an email
          </li>
          <li>Confirmed opt-in for all users who only signed up on one of our
            forms
          </li>
          <li>Confirmed opt-in, with multiple chances to confirm, for all
            existing users
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Confirmed opt-in for all existing users is tricky. We promised
          everyone who&#8217;s on our list that we&#8217;d contact them if SOPA
          came back. We don&#8217;t want to boot them from the list just because
          they neglect to open or read a single one of our emails carefully.
          Hopefully there&#8217;s a way to do this right.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you&#8217;ve taken the time to read this far, it probably means
          you care about us and the situation we&#8217;re in. Thanks. If you
          also have expertise or thoughts on how we can move forward, please be
          in touch. <a href="mailto:repairs@fightforthefuture.org">repairs@fightforthefuture.org</a>
