      <strong>Feb 15th: We beat back CISPA</strong>
      We’ve been fighting for your online security since before it was the hip
      thing to do. Long before Snowden, we mounted a massive resistance to smack
      down CISPA&mdash;a bill that would have given agencies like the NSA even more
      power to invade your family’s privacy. Together with Demand Progress, we
      delivered over 300,000 signatures to Congress within 2 days after CISPA
      was reintroduced.

      <strong>Battling "Six-Strikes" policies in the U.S. and giving people a
        better alternative</strong>
      ISP's and Hollywood came out to spy on and turn off people's Internet
      connection without due process in a program called Six Strikes. Corporate
      copyright holders, dismayed by their loss on SOPA legislation, went
      through a backdoor to get what they couldn't get from legislation. We
      called out their spying and abuse of monopoly power, and gave people a way
      to keep their private lives away from prying eyes by educating our members
      about <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/fftf">getting a
      VPN</a>.

      <strong>March 17: The Internet Defense League cat signal fights
        CISPA</strong>
      Telecom monopolies, defense contractors, and other corporate grinches were
      lobbying hard to pass CISPA. Its sponsor, Mike Rogers, claimed that no
      U.S. company opposed it&mdash;so we organized the tech community and raised
      the Cat Signal with Craigslist, Reddit, Mozilla, Duck Duck Go, Imgur,
      4chan and 30,000 other websites participating. And, after Mike Rogers
      tried to slam CISPA haters as “14-year-old tweeters”, we found one who
      would debate him.

      We couldn’t risk losing the public or the media’s attention on CISPA, so
      we kept the pressure on with a humorous video featuring Reddit Co-Founder
      Alexis Ohanian calling Google’s Larry Page that was viewed over 130,000.
      Feeling the heat from the public outcry, Facebook, Microsoft, and other
      tech companies dropped their support for CISPA.

      We know an important free speech fight when we see one, and when Cameron
      D’Ambrosio, a teenager from outside Boston, was arrested on terrorism
      charges for posting rap lyrics on Facebook, we swooped in. Within a few
      weeks, millions had learned Cam’s story through
      <a href="http://freecameron.org">our viral petition</a>, and we delivered
      over 90,000 signatures to the D.A. calling for Cam’s release, bringing
      international media attention to the issue. Days later, a grand jury
      refused to indict, and Cam’s charges were dropped.

      We were early core members of the StopWatching.Us coalition, helping
      gather hundreds of advocacy groups, tech companies, and celebrities to
      oppose NSA surveillance. We worked tirelessly behind the scenes to deliver
      signatures, plan actions, and bring in new members.

      <strong>We took an Amendment that no one thought had a chance and came
        within 6 votes of defunding NSA phone surveillance</strong>
      The network we helped build with the StopWatching.Us coalition became
      all-important when an unexpected opportunity presented itself in the form
      of the Amash Amendment, which would have de-funded some of the NSA’s
      programs. In two days, we drove tens of thousands of calls to congress and
      brought the amendment within 6 votes of passing. The media went nuts, and
      members of Congress knew that change was inevitable.

      <strong>July 4th: The largest online privacy protest in history&mdash;on TV,
        the web, and in the streets.</strong>
      On the Fourth of July, we helped the Internet declare its independence
      from government spying. We got the 4th Amendment plastered everywhere, on
      the streets, on the airwaves, and on websites like Wordpress, Namecheap,
      Upworthy, BoingBoing, Reddit, Mozilla, Imgur, and Cheezburger, all helping
      to amplify the Restore the 4th protests happening in over 100 cities. Our
      IDL action sent tens of thousands more emails to Congress, reached
      millions on social media, and our members crowdfunded
